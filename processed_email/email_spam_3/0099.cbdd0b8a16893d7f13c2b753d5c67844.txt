point to the same theori and practic in linux data storag redund that s todai s kernel configur section multi devic support let s talk first about the principl behind a raid setup raid us multipl disc for speed increas data storag or data redund fundament there ar number level of raid in linux linear raid number raid number raid number and raid number linear raid us two or more disc append data from on to anoth in other word when disc number is full disc number step in to store data there is no redund in linear raid onli an increas in storag capac further there s no mark increas in data access speed becaus you re access on drive in the raid arrai at a time raid number stripe data across the raid drive some data will be written to the first drive some to the second etc like linear raid raid number provid no redund becaus the data ha been written in parallel across the drive not all data exist on all drive lose a drive and your data is gone raid number will howev decreas data access time your system will run more quickli raid number unlik linear and raid number doe provid data redund thi is the first level in which data is mirror across the drive in the raid arrai all data that exist on on drive exist on all the other raid number requir at least two drive and thei should be of equal size otherwis your overal raid arrai will be the size of the smallest drive perform with raid number can actual be slower than with a singl drive or raid number as all the data is written across multipl disc raid number is for the most part pretti useless it reserv on disc for pariti inform while stripe the data across the other thi is much like linear mode with an addit disc thrown in for pariti data pariti data can be us to reconstruct and retriev the data on the other drive but thi realli isn t a redund method of data storag consequ raid number is probabl the least us of the raid scheme raid number is design for number or more disc and provid both redund and speed like raid number raid number pai close attent to pariti data howev rather than reserv a devic in the raid arrai for thi data it s written across the arrai becaus the pariti data is written across the arrai data recoveri can be accomplish fairli quickli in fact us a spare disc configur will allow raid number to reconstruct the data to the spare disc immedi after the failur of a drive becaus of it s increas speed and redund raid number is probabl the most common setup for multipl storag devic with all that in mind you ll need to make a choic in your kernel configur do you have mutlipl drive of the same size that you d like to configur as a raid arrai the multi devic support section of the kernel configur will allow you to do thi in fact you ll be abl to set the raid level as well again evalu your need and select the appropri option tomorrow it s on to network option in your kernel configur recommend it send us a gnomecor tip nbsp gnomefil savemymodem httpaddr savemymodem is an anti spam mail
