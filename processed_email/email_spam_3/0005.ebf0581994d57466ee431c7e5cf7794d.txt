i don t usual spend much time explain metaphor thei ar after all metaphor thei can be fill with whatev symbol you choos written well we all come to some similar understand of their mean but i ll depart todai contrari to my normal practic to take a few minut explain a recent metaphor i m a linux gui through and through as a user i see myself as right about at the averag on the curv for love of the languag and open sourc attitud though you d be hard press to find anyon with quit the same level of enthusiasm put simpli there s veri littl about the linux and broader open sourc world that i don t like or believ in take for exampl the practic of recurs acronym gnu gnu s not unix hurd herd of unix replac daemon wine wine is not an emul even php php hypertext processor all carri on the tradit of recurs in the unix linux world goofi as it sound i love thi stuff so it is that i set out to creat a recurs metaphor last week it could onli have happen on or about the numberth of juli in fact it happen in the edit of the numberrd i wrote a piec about how we american spend more time over the cours of a year talk about what s wrong with our system than what s right i wrote it know full well that mani of the respons i d get would be a from reader outsid the us and b in sharp disagr to my comment or those of citizen of other countri you re follow me right peopl would disagre with an articl that said we spend much time disagre thi of cours would prove my point in a somewhat metaphor wai the perfect recurs metaphor the point wa to be made yet more perfectli by the eventu inclus in penguin shell of the comment of someon from outsid the us disagre with my take our argument as american ideal thei would be comment that disagre with our collect american percept of be disagre thei would of cours point out thing about which citizen of other countri can disagre with american on by exercis the right to disagre we d subtli agre that we have that right yet anoth level of recurs and a final layer of metaphor the respons to both my own and johan sauvil s comment wa overwhelm in the main i believ both were appreci mani comment on the balanc of the two piec some reader were surpris i think to see a dissent opinion publish so quickli if at all overal the abil to express honestli held opinion to agre and to disagre on a global level close the circl on the metaphor in a perfect wai thing have howev gotten a bit more ugli in the past few dai i m not sure whether some were slow in get to the juli numberrd issu or whether it s just been stew sinc then take for instanc these comment by a reader who will remain mercifulli nameless we get enough america bash from our left wing whacko extremist press and school here in the usa that we don t wish to hear some insert favorit adject here from belgium whine too follow by pleas don t let toni singl handedli tarnish the fine reput of lockergnom i m sure there ar other articul linux expert out there who would be abl to replac him and in a later note on the topic censorship is to be encourag in a free market societi whenev and wherev it doesn t come from the govern clearli the metaphor just whizz right over the head of some chri ha been great about allow all hi author plenti of room in the editori piec at the begin of each newslett thi particular piec is no except he s shown a quiet confid in the face of some veri shrill comment while we all gener stai focus on technic issu chri ha shown unwav support for the notion that we geek ar in the end human with opinion and thought to share i think it s on of the thing that make the lockergnom newslett stand out from the pack the person touch so despit the irration of some of thi week s comment i ll continu to occasion throw in a person asid with the technic stuff just watch out recurs metaphor ar onli funni until someon put an ey out toni steidler dennison nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp gnometweak lockergnom reader save number on the comput encyclopedia ar you look

yesterdai i mention an interest review of two product for linux by codeweav crossov offic and crossov plugin you ve probabl heard of both by now as thei ve garner quit a bit of public both in and out of the linux world you ll recal that i promis to try to secur copi for review thi week with the help of a friendli sale rep at codeweav i wa abl to accomplish that task thi morn true to the second half of the promis we ll spend the next few dai look at these two product and how thei might impact your linux us let s take them in chronolog order start todai with crossov plugin a bit of background is in order codeweav is in their own word the lead corpor backer of the wine project wine ha been for the past sever year an ongo project to port window applic to linux it s a tough goal but it s also on that s been undertaken by other in the past year or so though the progress ha been slow the wine project ha manag to stai at the front of thi develop realm crossov plugin mark a chang in the philosophi of the wine project prior to it releas wine had taken a full system approach run window applic in wine requir the instal of a sizeabl daemon and no small amount of configur work crossov plugin ha move wine awai from the system wide approach to on that s much more modular rather than execut at system startup wine is call as need with the virtual window path to the call program when the program is close so is wine crossov plugin ha focus on creat linux function with on relat set of window applic browser plugin the result stand as a clear indic that the chang in philosophi is a success off the top crossov plugin bundl quicktim number window media player number number shockwav number number flash number and realplay number into a linux acces browser plugin packag throw in more esoter app like ipix trillian authorwar web player number and efax messeng number and you ve got virtual everi need plugin need cover but thi packag doesn t stop there includ in the crossov plugin packag ar viewer for word excel and powerpoint as well as sever microsoft orient font honestli i wa stun at the rang of applic offer by the codeweav develop have had some experi with wine i wa a bit leeri about the instal process and about the abil to get all these great applic to work with my redhat setup i ve never been complet success with wine but i hope for the best when i start the crossov plugin instal i realli did want these app to work the instal wa quit easi by run the instal crossov sh script from the command line i wa abl to instal the instal for both crossov plugin and crossov offic which we ll talk about tomorrow i start the plugin instal with quicktim a tool i ve admittedli miss in linux in the background crossov plugin had alreadi creat a virtual c drive on my machin i click on the quicktim instal and immedi saw a familiar sight the vise instal in it window format crossov plugin first check for feedback from the window binari open a virtual window window then step out while the vise instal took care of the rest though the instal fail four time it appear to be a server failur rather than a failur of the crossov program i kept retri ing and with some persist manag to get a full quicktim number instal download from the appl server quit liter the instal look and perform exactli as i ve seem mani time in window when the instal wa complet crossov again check for the window binari locat the appropri dll file in the virtual c drive and drop the plugin into the home toni netscap plugin and home toni mozilla plugin directori the process wa so smooth that i had to check the plugin list in these browser help about plugin sure enough the crossov quicktim plugin wa list quickli i ran out to the appl site and open the men in black ii movi trailer quicktim perform flawlessli i follow with the window media player shockwav flash ipix and efax messeng instal of those the onli on that weren t self contain in the crossov instal were ipix and efax even at that the instal point me to the window download then found the ex file when the download wa done within a half hour i had all instal and test then just for grin i instal realplay number via crossov thi wa despit the recommend in the instal screen to us the linux version it went as smoothli as the other with on caveat the player plai media file at a much faster speed than that in window fast enough to make me laugh in fact remind of dave and alvin the chipmunk ah well six out of seven is pretti strong given my previou troubl with wine i also instal a few font arial time new roman trebuchet and veranda in everi case the instal wa quick and absolut painless wine ha alwai held great promis at time it s been pain to watch the tediou pace of develop onli becaus that promis wa so allur with the back of codeweav and a fundament chang in the approach to develop wine ha final realiz the goal of integr window applic seamlessli into the stabl linux environ the result ar so strong that if i didn t know better i d swear that a few of these plugin actual run better in linux than in their nativ window honestli i didn t realiz how much i miss them until i start us them in
