exampl of cours wa the advanc in tape cassett technolog in the number and number includ dolbi sound technolog as with mpnumber thi technolog wa oppos by the music industri as differ from previou such

cassett tape which actual becam more popular than vinyl for a while befor the advent of cd technolog the thing is the music industri is well awar of thi effect and thei ar not realli aim to stop the privat exchang of song in mpnumber format if that were their goal thei d be institut widespread aggress legal action against all the server center node as thei did against all radio station plai their music in the number when thei realli thought the phenomenon wa go to wipe them out instead thei have focus on the best known servic first napster then morpheu kazaa and most recent audiogalaxi even in those case thei ve limit their legal challeng to thing thei know thei can win and thei ve avoid actual court trial whenev possibl to avoid the possibl of set some damag preced the point that seem to escap a lot of peopl is that copyright is not a properti in the same sens as most of the thing we think of as properti on kei differ is that if you don t defend it you lose it if you left your car sit in the drivewai with the window open and the kei in the ignit and somebodi drove awai in it that would still be theft and you d still be entitl to get your car back not so with copyright if you ar awar of infring and you do noth to try to stop it you ar voluntarili allow it to enter the public domain it s for the same reason that big compani insist that newspap put a copyright or trademark symbol after the name of their product whenev thei re mention and not us word like quot coke quot or quot kleenex quot as gener term thei don t realli expect everybodi to do what thei sai and thei re well awar that have the name of on s product becom the gener term for a product is actual a great market boon but if thei don t do that someon at some point could start us the word on their own product argu that it is in the public domain the effort of the music industri ar not aim at actual stop the exchang of music between individu which thei know from long experi increas their sale becaus most of the peopl who normal bui the music aren t realli satisfi with near perfect copi for most of them the learn curv and the cost in time of creat those copi themselv outweigh the cost of simpli bui the cd most of the outright piraci is commit by peopl who wouldn t have bought the music in the first place what the music industri is do is clearli aim at establish a public record of their effort to defend copyright in the broadest most public wai to prevent anyon from make a legal claim that the stuff thei own ha enter the public domain the thing thei re realli worri about in term of profit is the chang in the market model even legitim onlin music commerc threaten the album format with it tradit mix of a few good song and a bunch of other most peopl wouldn t pai for if thei were bui the stuff song by song the problem is how to make as much monei on a per song basi and at the moment it requir charg far more for an individu song that most peopl ar will to pai at ani rate copyright is actual a fairli complex matter of civil law with a good deal of histori behind it date back to the renaiss the strategi music compani us ar clearli direct to realiti and necess in light
