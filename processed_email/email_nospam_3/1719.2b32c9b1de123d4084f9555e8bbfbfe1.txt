 hi i wa inspir by a mode of oper support by vmware you can have a base disk imag share by multipl virtual machin vm instanc that base imag is never alter by a vm instanc instead each vm instanc write chang to it own redo log futur hard disk read from that vm instanc incorpor both the base imag and the appropri redo log to present the current disk imag for that specif virtual machin thi is describ here thank to duan for provid thi link on the honeypot mail list httpaddr could thi basic concept be us to easili make self fix client server applic that effici and automat recov from most attack even befor those attack have been discov here is what i imagin the physic architectur of most product client server system ar layer for exampl your basic web applic might have a web server run apach connect to an applic server run some jnumbere or net busi logic connect to a databas server for persist the onli on of these whose disk imag realli should evolv over time is the databas server and even here you often put the static rdbm softwar on on partit and the changeabl datafil on anoth partit it is onli the partit with the volatil datafil that must be allow to chang from on boot to the next other parit mai need to be writabl for sai swap space but these chang could be elimin on each reboot when someon crack thi system thei will probabl chang an imag that shouldn t be chang e g thei might leverag a buffer overflow in ii or apach to instal a trojan or a backdoor on the more expos web server but what if the web server ran off a base imag write chang to a delta or redo partit and then what if everi night it automat eras the redo partit and reboot the downtim involv for each machin would be minim becaus it is onli delet data rather than restor from backup in a system with redund web server for load balanc or high avail thi could be schedul in a wai such that the system is alwai access thi base redo partit concept could be implement at the same level as a featur of hardwar raid allow for greater perform reliabl and hack resist thi concept could also be appli to the applic server and even the databas server partit except for those partit which contain the tabl data file of cours doe anyon do thi alreadi or is thi a new concept or ha thi concept been discuss befor and abandon for some reason that i don t yet know i us the physic architectur of a basic web applic as an exampl in thi post but thi concept could of cours be appli to most server system it would allow for the hardwar separ of volatil and non volatil disk imag it would be analog to perform nightli ghost oper onli it would be more effici and involv less or no downtim thank for ani opinion ben
