 i did someth crude along those line for vm vax mayb number year ago there is at least on product that doe it for pc though i don t recal it name it is also handi for case where you have a cd imag of some filesystem or some other imag of a filesystem that is intrins readonli but whose filesystem will not accept or is not grace readonli storag it is also more or less necessari if you want to work with worm file structur which ar older still there have been a number of filesystem for those date back to the earli number if not befor a gener facil of the type you mention is also on wai to implement snapshot on top of an exist filesystem the written inform must obvious be seekabl so you can provid the illus that you wrote to the storag a devic level implement is howev perfectli adequ it doe not of cours distinguish for you what should have been chang and what should not if you truli know a devic or perhap a partit must not be written it can be simpler to either return error on write or to just return a fake success on write yet discard the data ntf live with the latter strategi just fine from my experi i have not tri it on extfnumb or reiser btw think about your mention of raid and consid the complex of write to raidnumb or raidnumb i would contend that with cheaper storag these dai it make littl sens to us raid save for shadow and possibl stripe those at least do not have the complex and slowup danger that higher raid level have and there is not a need to save the cost of disk so much where a singl disk mai hold number gig and up why not dedic anoth whole disk to fault recoveri and lose the complex and slow write sometim of raid glenn everhart origin messag from emailaddr emailaddr sent tuesdai septemb number number number number pm to webappsec securityfocu com secprog securityfocu subject us of base imag delta imag for autom recoveri from attack hi i wa inspir by a mode of oper support by vmware you can have a base disk imag share by multipl virtual machin vm instanc that base imag is never alter by a vm instanc instead each vm instanc write chang to it own redo log futur hard disk read from that vm instanc incorpor both the base imag and the appropri redo log to present the current disk imag for that specif virtual machin thi is describ here thank to duan for provid thi link on the honeypot mail list httpaddr could thi basic concept be us to easili make self fix client server applic that effici and automat recov from most attack even befor those attack have been discov here is what i imagin the physic architectur of most product client server system ar layer for exampl your basic web applic might have a web server run apach connect to an applic server run some jnumbere or net busi logic connect to a databas server for persist the onli on of these whose disk imag realli should evolv over time is the databas server and even here you often put the static rdbm softwar on on partit and the changeabl datafil on anoth partit it is onli the partit with the volatil datafil that must be allow to chang from on boot to the next other parit mai need to be writabl for sai swap space but these chang could be elimin on each reboot when someon crack thi system thei will probabl chang an imag that shouldn t be chang e g thei might leverag a buffer overflow in ii or apach to instal a trojan or a backdoor on the more expos web server but what if the web server ran off a base imag write chang to a delta or redo partit and then what if everi night it automat eras the redo partit and reboot the downtim involv for each machin would be minim becaus it is onli delet data rather than restor from backup in a system with redund web server for load balanc or high avail thi could be schedul in a wai such that the system is alwai access thi base redo partit concept could be implement at the same level as a featur of hardwar raid allow for greater perform reliabl and hack resist thi concept could also be appli to the applic server and even the databas server partit except for those partit which contain the tabl data file of cours doe anyon do thi alreadi or is thi a new concept or ha thi concept been discuss befor and abandon for some reason that i don t yet know i us the physic architectur of a basic web applic as an exampl in thi post but thi concept could of cours be appli to most server system it would allow for the hardwar separ of volatil and non volatil disk imag it would be analog to perform nightli ghost oper onli it would be more effici and involv less or no downtim thank for ani opinion ben thi transmiss mai contain inform that is privileg confidenti and or exempt from disclosur under applic law if you ar not the intend recipi you ar herebi notifi that ani disclosur copi distribut or us of the inform contain herein includ ani relianc thereon is strictli prohibit if you receiv thi transmiss in error pleas immedi contact the sender and destroi the materi in it entireti whether in electron or hard copi format thank you
