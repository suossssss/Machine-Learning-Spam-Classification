 on mon number number number at number number jim whitehead wrote you have not explain why the increas in conumb concentr is not contribut to increas global temperatur there ar a number of reason to think that conumb is not import to control global temperatur and that much of the conumb increas mai not be anthropogen some recent research point worth mention recent high resolut studi of histor conumb concentr and temperatur over hundr of thousand of year have shown a modest correl between the two in a number of case conumb level increas ar not in phase with temperatur increas and actual trail the increas in temperatur by a short time i e increas in temperatur preced increas in conumb concentr the more studi that ar done of the geolog record the more it seem that conumb concentr ar correl with temperatur increas but ar not significantli caus there is a lot of evid that conumb level ar regul in a fairli stabl fashion i don t believ anyon realli ha an authorit answer as to exactli how thi work yet with respect to absolut conumb concentr it is also import to point out that our best data to date suggest that thei follow a fairli regular cycl with a period of about number number year at previou cycl peak the concentr were similar to what thei ar now if thi cycl ha ani valid and we onli have good data for number number complet cyclic period but which look surprisingli regular in shape and time then we should be almost exactli at a peak right now as it happen current conumb concentr ar within number of other previou cyclic concentr peak for which we have good data in other word we mai be ad to the conumb level but it look a lot like we would be build a molehil on top of a mountain in the histor record at the veri least there is noth anomal about current conumb concentr also conumb level interact with the biospher in a manner that ultim affect temperatur again the interact is not entir predict but thi is believ to be on of the regul neg feedback system mention abov last as greenhous gase go conumb isn t particularli potent although it make up for it in volum in some case gase such as water and methan have a far greater impact as greenhous gase on a per molecul basi water vapor mai actual be the kei greenhous ga someth that conumb onli indirectli effect through it interact with the biospher conumb wa an easi mark for earli environment but all the recent studi and data i ve seen give me the impress that it is larg a passeng on the climat ride rather than the driver i certainli don t think it is a healthi fixat if we re actual interest in understand warm trend cheer jame roger emailaddr
