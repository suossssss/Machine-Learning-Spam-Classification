 i have translat the articl in full see end of post i think that i ve done a far better job than the googl translat at least it s readabl now ani correct appreci stuff in s is my and other addit to the debat my apolog if i ve paraphras anybodi incorrectli i will be glad to retract if anyon is mif the articl make four main point number absenc of critic claus in thi case the idea is that the licenc is invalid becaus it doesn t specifi under what countri s law the gpl is govern number specif in english onli that for the end user as oppos to busi the gpl doesn t appli becaus it s not written in french number arbitari licenc chang the point here is that under french law the author can chang the term of the licenc arbitarili thi is becaus ani grant of right by an author must be clearli delimit in term of how long where to whom date and time in the absenc of such limit the origin author ha the right to chang hi softwar back to close on a whim david neari make the point that the copyright holder automat retain the right to chang the licenc scott repli it simpli requir authoris from all copyright holder that s not my understand french law allow a gpl type licenc on condit that the specif condit of the grant of such right ar clear if thei ar not there is noth to stop the origin author take back hi work the lawyer see thi correctli imho as a weak in the gpl number hidden defect roughli thi claus mean that the author s is ar liabl for ani defect if the consum is not an it engin so if linux blow up and data is lost then the author ar liabl ciaran johnson sai that mdollaroft and other have similar claus the point here is that thei ar all invalid just that thi on affect the gpl also niall o broinn make the point that it is not a sale but rather a servic leas arrang and that s why it doesn t come under thi point i would suggest that the whole thrust of thi articl ha been to see softwar sale even if no monei chang hand as govern veri much by consum law in franc anywai rick moen make the point that it is not a sale but rather a grant of right which ar not default see the bit about even the grant of right by an author have to be explicitli specifi under french law the fact that two ip lawyer in franc think that the gpl is cover as a sale make me feel that there is a de facto sale and a de facto contract number roughli there mai be other reason under french law why the gpl mai be invalid whole articl freedom a is worth more than these imperfect licenc specialis lawyer look at the gpl lawyer cyril rojinski duli appoint to the court and the jurist vincent grynbaum both specialis in the area of intellectu properti examin the free licenc and in particular the gpl thei have publish their studi in the review propriet intellectuel intellectu properti number and their conclus is grim their approach is interest the problem for them is not to know whether freedom is valid under french law for them the question is a moot point but rather thei ask themselv about the form and the content of the text of free licenc and in particular the gpl the problem is not free programm but rather the licenc contract of free programm absenc of critic claus the author tell us that first of all the refer to copyright is not legal suffici in the framework of intern contract which is the case of licenc contract for programm develop and spread via the internet the idea of copyright can basic includ differ from on countri to anoth thi is why under intern contract it is necessari to specifi to which law on is refer french law american c the author onli found three public licenc which were correctli formul on thi point qpl ibm public licenc and the mozilla public licenc specif in the english languag next the author remind us that at least in franc no claus in a contract mai be contrari to french law number howev it turn out that a licenc such as the gpl is contrari to french law in sever respect firstli it is written in english and the fsf doesn t offici approv translat the toubon law oblig thi sort of contract to be written in french includ for busi sinc the notion of user appli not onli to consum but also to busi profession c contact by the editor of linuxfrench lawyer cyril rojinski declar that as far as busi is concern the toubon law is probabl doom to chang sinc it is in contradict of european direct on the subject but whatev about that the problem is still valid for individu and while wait for it french law to chang french compani have to deal with it sinc it is the law of the land a programm under the gpl can suddenli chang licenc anoth problem much more seriou is that accord to french law the author of a free programm can at ani time invok the invalid of the licenc for thi softwar by simpli chang the licenc in effect the law of intellectu properti stipul that the grant of right by the author is subordin to the condit that each of these grant right be the object of a distinct claus in the grant act i e the licenc and that the grant of ani such right be delimit with respect to it scope and it grante and also with respect to it locat i e where such right mai be excersis and durat of ani such grant number thi is not the case of the gpl nor of other free licenc briefli thi mean that in franc or elsewher if the author is french that which is under the gpl could revert to proprietari from on dai to the next the problem of the guarante hidden defect an other veri seriou flaw is that of the guarante the gpl licenc and other show that the softwar is deliv without guarante you ar go to immedi repli that commerc programm carri the same claus in their licenc contract and thi is correct howev whatev is written in a licenc contract on cannot free oneself from the guarante from hidden defect sinc it is impos in the civil code thi concept is poorli understood by the layman it protect the buyer whoever it mai be individu or busi sinc it specifi the civil code and not consum protect law against hidden defect deliber or made in good faith by the seller for exampl if on bui a pair of sock in a sale and the shop ha a notic specifi that sale item ar neither refund nor exchang and on arriv home you notic that on of the sock ha a hole in it sever scenario ar possibl you could have check the sock befor purchas the flaw is deem obviou and you can sing for your monei you couldn t check the sock thei were packag for exampl and in thi case despit the notic neither refund nor exchang you mai invok hidden defect and have them chang or obtain a refund it s up to you person i have alreadi invok in shop the hidden defect claus and it alwai work well shopkeep ar alwai veri cooper if you quot a coupl of word of the civil code the concept of hidden defect is rather wide it is necessari that you hadn t the possibl of discov the defect befor bui the product and then accord to the civil code that you wouldn t have bought it at that price if you had known about the defect the third case which is much rarer is if you ar abl to show that the vendor had knowledg of the defect hidden but didn t inform you in thi case not onli doe he have to reimburs the product but all expens incur by the sale metro ticket to go to the shop the fuse which blew when you plug it in c thi idea of hidden defect appli to all product includ programm thi wa made abundantli clear by the author and the court surround ynumberk thi is particularli inconveni for free programm sinc a site which offer a linux distro for download is suppos to provid a guarante against hidden flaw linuxfrench ask cyril rojinski if in the case of a free programm on could speak about a hidden defect sinc the sourc code wa avail he repli actual concern the guarante the question of obviou defect will aris thi analyi will be differ depend on whether the person who download the distribut is an it profession or not opensourc ha thi advantag over the proprietari programm it protect the distributor against a guarante of hidden defect insofar as the bui is an it person but for distribut to the public at larg the problem remain the same roughli speak lawyer cyril rojinski said it himself thi studi is far from be exhaust and mani other area could be explor dure thi interview we ask ourselv for exampl about the fragil of the gpl claus which forbid link sourc code under the gpl with proprietari code in effect the law of intellectu properti give the right to the user to modifi a programm with the intent of permit interoper with anoth programm if for that i need to link with a proprietari librari commun protocol devic driver i mai consid as null and void thi claus of the gpl the conclus of thi studi is a wake up call for the commun freedom merit more than these shoddi licenc which should be modifi
