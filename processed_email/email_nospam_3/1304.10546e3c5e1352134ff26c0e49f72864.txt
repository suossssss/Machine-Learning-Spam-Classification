 onc upon a time ben wrote i us a mostli red hat number number system but prefer to configur and build my kernel by hand i d like to humbl offer a tweak to alsa driver spec that help it build cleanli under such circumst i recogn that freshrpm net packag ar design with standard red hat in mind includ a standard kernel rpm howev i hope that matthia will consid the tweak small enough to justifi it incorpor well i don t realli find it consist at all to us an rpm packag built against someth that wasn t instal through rpm what i d recommend in your case you should keep at least on origin red hat linux kernel you do just in case right and instal the match alsa kernel packag as you ll need at least on becaus of the depend then for your custom built kernel simpli configur with card all make make instal destdir tmp alsa driver from the alsa driver sourc then as root copi all the modul under tmp alsa driver lib modul to your modul dir and run depmod a of cours you can even make it much faster by not compil all un need driver as i guess that s on of the reason on would rebuild hi own kernel i find thi the easiest and cleanest wai to get around the problem it s what i ve done and what i ll keep do on my laptop where i m run a kernel recompil with acpi matthia clean custom red hat linux rpm packag httpaddr red hat linux releas number number valhalla run linux kernel number number number numberacpi load number number number number number number rpm list mail list httpaddr
