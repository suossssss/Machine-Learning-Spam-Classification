acceler wa conceiv to meet the steadi adopt of xml the anticip futur prolifer of web servic and as a mean to share data between two busi our vision is to build out an xml awar infrastructur kelli said the xanumb is the first of a famili kelli explain that convert data into xml increas the file size up to number time thi he said make process the data veri tax on applic server datapow believ an inlin devic is the best altern in addit to the larg file size secur is also of paramount import in the world of xml todai s firewal ar design to inspect http traffic onli kelli said a soap packet with xml will go straight through a firewal firewal ar blind to xml todai futur product in datapow famili will focu more specif on secur especi as web servic prolifer kelli said accord to datapow most exist solut to offload xml process ar homegrown and done in softwar an approach the compani itself tri initi and found to be inadequ with regard to speed and secur after try the softwar path the compani turn to creat a solut that would process xml in hardwar our xgnumber execut core convert xml to machin code said kelli ad that to hi knowledg no other compani s solut doe kelli said in the next few month he expect the market to be flood with technolog that claim to do xml process claim that he believ will be mostli fals other content awar switch such as ssl secur socket layer acceler and load balanc look at the first number byte of a packet while the xanumb provid deeper packet inspect look at number number byte and thu enabl greater process of xml data kelli explain the numberu high network devic ha been test against a larg collect of xml and xsl data type and can learn new flavor of the markup languag as thei pass through the devic the xanumb can be deploi in proxi mode behind a firewal and a load balanc and it will inspect all traffic that pass and will identifi and process those packet that ar xml kelli said in addit to proxi mode the devic can also be us as an applic co processor thi deploy method give administr more granular control over what data is inspect and the applic server itself control the devic datapow is not the onli compani chase thi emerg market startup
