me that thei weren t exactli poor to start with actual if i rememb correctli from discuss of the list s composit in forb about five or six year ago the best wai to get on the forb number is to have no colleg at all can you sai bootstrap boi and girl i knew you could sure discuss in forb rigor research that especi when the data in their own list contradict them i continu to look at the list and all the inherit grow entri i guess if i read it enough time my vision will clear given that an undergradu liber art degre from a state school like sai mine is noth but stuff thei should have taught you in a govern run high school you ll probabl get more of those on the forb number as well as time goe on if we ever get around to have a good old fashion govern collaps transfer payment depress an econom version of thi summer s govern forest conflagr caus by the same kind of innumeraci that not clear cut enough forest did out west thi summer that should motiv more than a few erst slacker out there includ me to learn to actual feed themselv the next categori on the forb number list is someon with a termin profession degre like an mba phd md etc from the best school possibl why becaus as of about number the best wai to get into harvard for instanc is to be smart not rich don t take my word for it ask their admiss offic look at the admiss stat over the year for proof i at on point look into stanford busi school after learn that tuition wa numberk no financi aid wa avail and part time work wa disallow thi smart person decid that i wa not will to spend the dollarnumb applic fee non refund dure attend at my local busi school i wa told repeatedli i should have gone for it to quot a prof northwestern mba it ha noth to do with the educ you receiv in gener european and canadian busi school ar better and more innov it the connect he us the word american nobil meritocraci american style wa invent at the ivi leagu after world war ii even stanford got the hint and of cours chicago taught them all how right practic nobodi who goe to a top number american institut of higher learn can actual afford to go there these dai unless of cours their parent who couldn t afford to go there themselv got termin degre in the last number year or so and their kid still had to get the grade and bias by intellig test score to get in invent be the right word dubya went to yale and hb i guess practic get you around that problem the bizarr ironi is that almost all of those peopl with termin degre until thei actual own someth and hire peopl or learn to make someth for a live all dai on a profit and loss basi persist in the practic insan belief like life after death that econom is some kind of zero sum game that dumb peopl who don t work hard for it make all the monei and if someon is smart work hard and is rich then thei stole their wealth somehow btw none of you gui out there hold the short end of thi rhetor stick can blame me for the fact that i m us it to beat you sever all over your collect head and shoulder you were appar too dumb to grab the right end i went to missouri and i don t have a degre in anyth actual us much less a termin on which mean i m broker than anyon on thi list it s just that you of all peopl lot with educ far surpass my own should just plain know better the fact speak for themselv if you just open your ey and look there ar no epicycl the univers doe not orbit the earth and econom is not a zero sum game the cost of anyth includ ignor and destitut is the forgon altern in thi case intellig and effort i will howev admit to be educ waai past my level of compet and by the wai you discuss econom so have you appar it interest but in thi part of the world nova scotia a recent studi found that colleg graduat earn less than graduat of number year commun colleg trade school thei did declin to mention that the demand for some trade is so great that some of them ar demand univers degre to get in just for the record the averag salari for a univers graduat includ advanc degre holder here is cdollar number number btw if we ever actual had free market in thi countri includ the abolit of redistribut incom and death tax all those smart peopl in the forb number would have more monei and there would be more self made peopl on that list in addit most of the peopl who inherit monei on the list would have much less of it not even rel speak final practic all of that new monei would have come from econom effici and not stolen from someon els invest bubbl or not that effici is call progress for those of you in the peopl s republ of berkelei or cambridg it mean more and better stuff cheaper over time a terribl petit bourgeoi concept appar not worthi of teach by the educ elit or you d know about it by now in econom term it s also call an increas in gener welfar and no virginia i m not talk about extort monei from someon who work and give it to someon who doesn t in order to keep them from work and thei can think of some politician as santa clau come elect time much as i like to accept what you sai i do believ in free market i have difficulti find ani except of cours for labor market which govern go to great length to protect well unless the suppli is tight it wa a great run with the technolog industri produc most of the self made billionair on the list but now we ve got a govern sponsor monopoli and the concept of more stuff
