 jeremi hylton i think on step toward deploy is creat a re usabl token for mail messag the current codebas doesn t expos an easi to us or easi to custom token token couldn t be easier to us it take a string argument and produc a stream of token whether via explicit list or gener or tupl or doesn t matter all the token function in gbay py and timtest py ar freeli interchang thi wai note that we have no evid to support that a customiz token would do ani good or if it would in which wai custom could be help that s a research issu on which no work ha been done the timtest modul seem to contain an enorm bodi of practic knowledg about how to pars mail messag but the modul wasn t design for re us that s partli a failur of imagin split out all knowledg of token is just a larg block cut and past there it s done chang the from timtoken import token at the top to us ani other token now if you want to make it easier still feel free to check in someth better i d like to see a modul that can take a singl messag or a collect of messag and token each on the msg and msgstream class in timtest py ar a start at that but it s hard to do anyth truli us here when peopl us all sort of differ physic represent for email msg mbox in variou format on file per folder on file per msg skip s gzip gimmick if you re a python coder you should find it veri easi to chang the gut of msg and msgstream to handl your peculiar scheme defin interfac for these gui should be done i d like to see the token by customiz too tim had to exclud some header from hi test data becaus there were particular bias in the test data if other peopl have test data without those bias thei ought to be abl to custom the token to includ them or exclud other thi sound like a bottomless pit to me and there s no easier wai to custom than to edit the code as readm txt still sai though massiv refactor would help hop to it
