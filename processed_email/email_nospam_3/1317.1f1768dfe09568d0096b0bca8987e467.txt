 well i don t realli find it consist at all to us an rpm packag built against someth that wasn t instal through rpm follow that reason i ve been instal all my custom built kernel through rpm recent i find it annoi though that alsa kernel and similar packag will onli build for the current run kernel so i ve attach a patch to specifi an altern kernel by set the target kernel environ variabl befor run rpmbuild you still need to have the rpm for the specifi kernel instal but at least it doesn t have to be current run it s kinda hackish so if someon ha a better wai to do thi let me know that idea look good although it mayb need to be tweak a bit more what you sent doesn t support packag name kernel smp i d also prefer a cleaner wai than the env variabl and preferr not edit the spec probabl defin target number number xx xx with smp sound good enough the buildrequir on kernel sourc will also need to be remov becaus it won t necessarili need to be true and that doe bug me a bit me and my kernel rpm build thi all work along the same idea i have been aim for but the freak redhat kernel srpm still have been stump if we could get thi and the alsa driver stuff work it would be whole lot easier to try out a newer kernel but then the size of these rpm ar huge at least for us nnumber world courti i will keep watch and hope that somebodi come up with a great work idea thank gui mail lee rpm list mail list httpaddr
