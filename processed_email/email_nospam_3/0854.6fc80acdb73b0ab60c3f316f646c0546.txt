 i want to get back to thi but didn t have the time i actual live on a coupl differ indian reserv grow up in the pacif northwest and also spent a fair amount time in lakota sioux countri as well and my parent have live on an even more divers rang of indian reserv than i have my experi be a direct result of live with my parent i do get a lot of my inform first hand or in some case second hand from my father the incom figur for the indian ar somewhat mislead mostli becaus it is realli hard to do proper account of the effect incom while it is true that some indian live in genuin poverti it is typic as a consequ of previou poor decis that were made by the tribe not someth that wa impress upon them the primari problem with the account is that there is a tribal entiti that exist separ from the individu typic an indian corpor of on type or anoth where each member of the tribe own a singl share the detail of when and how a share becom activ vari from tribe to tribe in most tribe a dividend is paid out to each of the tribal member from the corpor usual to the tune of dollarnumb numberk per person depend on the tribe the dividend monei come from a number of place with the primari sourc be the feder gov t and variou busi asset own by the indian corpor you have to understand a coupl thing first a great mani indian tribe ar run as pure communist enterpris everyon get a check for their share no matter what on of the biggest problem thi ha caus is veri high unemploy often number number for tribal member who ar more than happi take their dividend and not work the dividend thei receiv from the corpor often constitut their sole incom for govern account purpos unfortun to support thi type of econom when no on work thei ve had to sell off most of their us asset to maintain those dividend mani of the tribe genuin live in poverti do so becaus thei have run out of thing to sell yet nobodi work on of the ironi is that on mani of the reserv where the tribe still have asset to burn mani of the peopl work in the store and such ar actual poor white folk not indian second even though the tribe member each get a cash dividend thei also receiv an enorm rang of benefit and perk from the indian corpor to the tune of ten of thousand of dollar per person annual by benefit and perk we ar talk about the kind of thing no other ordinari american receiv from either their employ or the govern it should be point out that while mani of these indian corpor ar ineptli run and mostli provid sinecur for other indian a minor ar veri smartli manag and a few hire non indian busi execut with good credenti to run their busi divis an exampl of thi is the haida corpor which while have less number number tribal sharehold ha billion of dollar in asset and the variou corpor thei own have gross revenu in the dollarnumb number million rang and grow yet the dividend paid out is strictli control about dollarnumberk in thi particular case and thei engag in a practic of wait a coupl decad befor draw monei from ani of the asset thei were grant which ha led to intellig invest and us thei don t eat their seed corn and have actual manag to grow their stash in contrast a coupl island over there is anoth tribe of number number peopl that ha a net loss of about dollarnumb million annual iirc while be regularli endow by the feder govern with sever billion of dollar in valuabl asset thi particular tribe ha a modest incom in theori but the actual expenditur per person annual is in the hundr of thousand of dollar and mani borrow monei against futur incom incident in thi particular case the peopl that ar work frequent pull in a few hundr thousand dollar a year much of which goe back to the tribal corpor rather than their own pocket somewhat annoi the feder govern semi regularli grant valuabl asset to these tribe when thei ve burn through the on previous given where feasibl typic sell the asset to american or foreign compani and the cycl continu so what is the primari problem for the tribe that have problem in a nutshel a thoroughli patholog cultur and societi few women reach the ag of number without get pregnant incest rape and gross promiscu is rampant inbreed heavi drug abus dure pregnanc and other environment factor have creat tribe where a veri substanti fraction of the tribe is liter mental retard mani of the thought and intellig tribe member leav the reserv at the earliest opportun mostli to avoid the problem mention abov on on reserv my parent live the hiv infect rate wa number mani of these societi ar thoroughli corrupt and the administr of the law is arbitrari and caprici thei do have their own judg court polic etc in short mani of these tribe that ar still hang togeth ar in a shambl becaus thei have becom the most patholog societi that i have ever seen anywher becaus of their legal statu there realli aren t that mani consequ for their behavior there ar mani thing that i could tell you that i ve seen that you probabl would not believ unless you d seen it yourself there ar alwai good peopl in these tribe but it ha gotten to the point where the loser and idiot outnumb the good gui by a fair margin mani time and thi is a mobocraci typic btw if ani of you white folk want to experi overt and aggress racism as a minor in a place where the rule of law is fiction and the polic ar openli thug try live on on of these mess up indian reserv it will give you an interest perspect on thing there ar onli two real situat where you find reason prosper indian the first is in the rare case of tribe run by disciplin and intellig peopl that have manag their asset wise the second is where the tribe ha dispers and assimil for the most part even if thei maintain their tribal ident in both of these case the tribal leader reject the insular behavior that tend to lead to the patholog case mention abov the indian ar often quit wealthi technic and a lot of monei is spent by the tribe per capita and the actual report incom is quit high when you consid how mani ar live entir off the tribal dole it is just that their peculiar econom structur doe not lend itself well to ordinari econom analysi by mere look at their nomin incom the poverti is social and cultur in natur not econom thi wa my origin point on a tangent on thing that ha alwai interest me is the concept of quasi tribal corpor social mani indian tribe implement a type of corpor social that is mind bogglingli bad in execut that thei us thi structur at all is an accid of histori more than anyth but what ha interest me is that the veri smartli manag on do surprisingli well over the long run it is like a famili corpor writ larg it seem that in a futur where famili ti will be increasingli voluntari the gener concept mai have some merit in gener western societi serv to creat a facsimil of a biolog extend famili with the includ dynam but with an arbitrari set of self select individu damn that wa long and it late and it could have been a lot longer jame roger
