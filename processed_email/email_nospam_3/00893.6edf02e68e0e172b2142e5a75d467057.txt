program languag as work environ number acquir a sens of eleg number refer the valu of analog program languag design is a compar new activ it ha exist for less than half a centuri so it is often worthwhil to look to older design disciplin to understand better thi new activ thu my book principl of program languag design evalu and implement grew out of a studi of teach method in architectur primarili but also of pedagogi in other disciplin such as aircraft design perhap you have also seen analog drawn between program languag and car fortran model t c dune buggi etc these analog can be veri inform and can serv as intuit pump to enhanc our creativ but thei cannot be us uncrit becaus thei ar in the end just analog ultim our design decis must be base on more than analog sinc analog can be mislead as well as inform in thi essai i ll address the role of aesthet in program languag design but i will base my remark on a book about structur engin the tower and the bridg by david p billington although there ar mani differ between bridg and program languag we will find that mani idea and insight transfer rather directli accord to billington there ar three valu common to mani technolog activ which we can call the three e s effici economi and eleg these valu correspond to three dimens of technolog which billington call the scientif social and symbol dimens the three s s we will consid each in turn effici seek to minim resourc us in structur engin effici deal with the amount of materi us the basic criterion is safeti and the issu ar scientif strength of materi disposit of forc etc similarli in program languag design effici is a scientif question deal with the us of resourc there ar mani exampl where effici consider influenc program languag design some ar review in my principl of program languag in the earli dai the resourc to be minim were often runtim memori usag and process time although compil time resourc util wa also relev in other case the resourc econom wa programm type time and there ar well known case in which thi compromis safeti e g fortran s implicit declar there ar also mani well known case in which secur i e safeti wa sacrif for the sake of effici by neglect runtim error check e g arrai bound check effici issu often can be quantifi in term of comput memori or time but we must be care that we ar not compar appl and orang compil time is not interchang run time and neither on is the same as programm time similarli comput memori cannot be trade off against comput time unless both ar reduc to a common denomin such as monei but thi bring in econom consider to which we now turn economi seek to maxim benefit versu cost wherea effici is a scientif issu economi is a social issu in structur engin economi seek to maxim social benefit compar to it cost thi is especi appropri sinc structur like bridg ar usual built at public expens for the benefit of the public in program languag design the public that must be satisfi is the program commun that will us the languag and the institut for which these programm work econom tradeoff ar hard to make becaus econom valu chang and ar difficult to predict for exampl the shift from first to second gener program languag wa larg a result of a decreas in the cost of comput time compar to programm time the shift from the second to the third gener involv the increas cost of residu bug in program and the fourth gener reflect the increas cost of program mainten compar to program develop other social factor involv in the success or failur of a program languag includ whether major manufactur support the languag whether prestigi univers teach it whether it is approv in some wai by influenti organ such as the us depart of defens whether it ha been standard whether it come to be perceiv as a real languag us by real programm or as a toi languag us by novic or dilettant and so forth as can be seen from the histor remark in my principl social factor ar frequent more import than scientif factor in determin the success or failur of a program languag often econom issu can be quantifi in term of monei but the monetari valu of cost and benefit ar often unstabl and unpredict becaus thei depend on chang market forc also mani social issu from dissatisfact with poorli design softwar to human miseri result from system failur ar inaccur repres by the singl dimens of monetari cost all kind of cost and benefit must be consid in seek an econom design eleg symbol good design eleg who care about eleg snort the hard nose engin but billington show clearli the critic role of eleg in hard nose engin for the design it is well known that featur interact pose a seriou problem for languag design becaus of the difficulti of analyz all the possibl interact of featur in a languag see my principl for exampl structur engin face similar problem of analyt complex but billington observ that the best design don t make extens us of comput model and calcul on reason is that mathemat analysi is alwai incomplet the engin must make a decis about which variabl ar signific and which ar not and an analysi mai lead to incorrect conclus if thi decis is not made well also equat ar often simplifi e g made linear to make their analysi feasibl and thi is anoth potenti sourc of error becaus of these limit engin that depend on mathemat analysi mai overdesign a structur to compens for unforeseen effect left out of the analysi thu the price of safeti is addit materi and increas cost i e decreas effici and economi similarli in program languag design the limit of the analyt approach often forc us to make a choic between an under engin design in which we run the risk of unanticip interact and an over engin design in which we have confid but which is ineffici or uneconom mani peopl have seen the famou film of the collaps in number of the four month old tacoma narrow bridg it vibrat itself to piec in a storm becaus aerodynam stabil had not been consid in it design billington explain that thi accid along with a number of less dramat bridg failur wa a consequ of an increas us of theoret analys that began in the number howev the veri problem that destroi the tacoma narrow bridg had been anticip and avoid a centuri befor by bridg design who were guid by aesthet principl accord to billington the best structur engin do not reli on mathemat analysi although thei do not abandon it altogeth rather their design activ is guid by a sens of eleg thi is becaus solut to structur engin problem ar usual greatli underdetermin that is there ar mani possibl solut to a particular problem such as bridg a particular river therefor expert design restrict their attent to design in which the interact of the forc is easi to see the design look unbalanc if the forc ar unbalanc and the design look stabl if it is stabl the gener principl is that design that look good will also be good and therefor the design process can be guid by aesthet without extens but incomplet mathemat analysi billington express thi idea by invert the old architectur maxim and assert that in structur design function follow form he add p number when the form is well chosen it analysi becom astoundingli simpl in other word the choic of form is open and free so we should pick form where eleg design express good design i e effici and econom design if we do so then we can let aesthet guid design the same appli to program languag design by restrict our attent to design in which the interact of featur is manifest in which good interact look good and bad interact look bad we can let our aesthet sens guid our design and we can be much more confid that we have a good design without have to check all the possibl interact for the user in thi case what s good for the design also is good for the user nobodi is comfort cross a bridg that look like it will collaps at ani moment and nobodi is comfort us a program languag in which featur mai explod if combin in the wrong wai the manifest balanc of forc in a well design bridg give us confid when we cross it so also the manifestli good design of our program languag should reinforc our confid when we program in it becaus we have well justifi confid in the consequ of our action we accomplish littl by cover an unbalanc structur in a beauti facad when the bridg is unabl to sustain the load for which it wa design and collaps it won t much matter that it wa beauti on the outsid so also in program languag if the eleg is onli superfici that is if it is not the manifest of a deep coher in the design then programm will quickli see through the illus and loos their unwarr confid in summari good design choos to work in a region of the design space where good design look good as a consequ these design can reli on their aesthet sens as can the user of the structur bridg or program languag thei design we mai miss out on some good design thi wai but thei ar of limit valu unless both the design and the user can be confid that thei ar good design we mai summar the preced discuss in a maxim analog to those in my principl of program languag the eleg principl confin your attent to design that look good becaus thei ar good the program languag as work environ there ar other reason that eleg is relev to a well engin program languag the program languag is someth the profession programm will live with even live in it should feel comfort and safe like a well design home or offic in thi wai it can contribut to the qualiti of the activ that take place within it would you work better in an orient garden or a sweatshop a program languag should be a joi to us thi will encourag it us and decreas the programm s fatigu and frustrat the program languag should not be a hindranc but should serv more as a collabor encourag programm to do their job better as some automobil ar drive machin and work as a natur extens of the driver so a program languag should be a program machin by encourag the programm to acquir the smooth compet and seemingli effortless skill of a virtuoso the program languag should invit the programm to design eleg effici and econom program through it aesthet dimens a program languag symbol mani valu for exampl in the varieti of it featur it mai symbol proflig excess spare economi or ascetic the kind of it featur mai repres intellectu sophist down to earth practic or ignor crude thu a program languag can promot a set of valu by embodi certain valu it encourag us to think about them by neglect or negat other valu it allow them to reced into the background and out of our attent out of sight out of mind acquir a sens of eleg aesthet is notori difficult to teach so you mai wonder how you ar suppos to acquir that refin sens of eleg necessari to good design billington observ that thi sens is acquir through extens experi in design which especi in europ is encourag by a competit process for choos bridg design becaus of it structur engin design mani more bridg than thei build and thei learn from each competit thei loos by compar their own design with those of the winner and other loser the public also critiqu the compet design and in thi wai becom more educ their sens of eleg develop along with that of the design so also to improv as a program languag design you should design mani languag design obsess and critic revis and discard your design you should also evalu and critic other peopl s design and try to improv them in thi wai you will acquir the bodi of experi you will need when the real thing come along refer number billington david p the tower and the bridg the new art of structur engin princeton princeton
