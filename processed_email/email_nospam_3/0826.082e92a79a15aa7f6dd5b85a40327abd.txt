 httpaddr the new yorker the next world order by nichola lemann the bush administr mai have a brand new doctrin of power issu of number number number post number number number when there is a chang of command and not just in govern the new peopl often persuad themselv that the old peopl were much wors than anyon suspect thi feel seem especi intens in the bush administr perhap becaus bill clinton ha been bracket by a father son team it s easi for peopl in the administr to believ that after an unfortun eight year interlud the bush famili ha resum it govern and about time too the bush administr s sens that the clinton year were a wast or wors is strongest in the realm of foreign polici and militari affair republican tend to regard democrat as untrustworthi in defens and foreign polici anywai in wai that coincid with what peopl think of as clinton s weak point an eager to pleas a lack of disciplin condoleezza rice bush s nation secur advis wrote an articl in foreign affair two year ago in which she contemptu accus clinton of an extraordinari neglect of the fiduciari respons of the command in chief most of the top figur in foreign affair in thi administr also serv under the presid s father thei took offic last year after what thei regard as eight year of small time flyswat by clinton think that thei were pick up where thei d left off not long ago i had lunch with sorri a senior administr foreign polici offici at a restaur in washington call the oval room earli in the lunch he hand me a twenti seven page report whose cover bore the seal of the depart of defens an outlin map of the world and these word defens strategi for the number the region defens strategi secretari of defens dick chenei januari number on of the difficulti of work at the highest level of govern is commun it drama actor profession athlet and even elect politician train for year go through a great winnow and then perform publicli peopl who have titl like deputi assist secretari of defens ar just as ambiti and competit have work just as long and hard and ar often plai for even higher stake but what thei do all dai is go to meet and write memo and prepar brief how possibl to explain that some of the document includ the report that the senior offici hand me which wa physic indistinguish from a high school term paper repres the govern version of plai carnegi hall after the fall of the berlin wall dick chenei then the secretari of defens set up a shop as thei sai to think about american foreign polici after the cold war at the grand strateg level the project whose exist wa kept quiet includ peopl who ar now back in the game at a higher level among them paul wolfowitz the deputi secretari of defens lewi libbi chenei s chief of staff and eric edelman a senior foreign polici advis to chenei gener speak a cohes group of conserv who regard themselv as bigger think tougher mind and intellectu bolder than most other peopl in washington donald rumsfeld the secretari of defens share these characterist and ha been close associ with chenei for more than thirti year colin powel then the chairman of the joint chief of staff mount a compet and presum more ideolog moder effort to reimagin american foreign polici and defens a date wa set mai number number on which each team would brief chenei for an hour chenei would then brief presid bush after which bush would make a foreign polici address unveil the new grand strategi everybodi work for month on the five twenti on brief with a sens that the shape of the post cold war world wa at stake when wolfowitz and powel arriv at chenei s offic on mai numberst wolfowitz went first but hi brief last far beyond the allot hour and chenei a hawk who perhap like what he wa hear did not call time on him powel didn t get to present hi altern version of the futur of the unit state in the world until a coupl of week later chenei brief presid bush us materi mostli from wolfowitz and bush prepar hi major foreign polici address but he deliv it on august number number the dai that iraq invad kuwait so nobodi notic the team kept work in number the time got it hand on a version of the materi and publish a front page stori sai that the pentagon envis a futur in which the unit state could and should prevent ani other nation or allianc from becom a great power a few week of controversi ensu about the bush administr s hawk be unilater controversi that chenei s peopl put an end to with denial and the counter leak of an edit softer version of the same materi as it becam appar that bush wa go to lose to clinton the chenei team s effort took on the qualiti of a part shot the report that the senior offici hand me at lunch had been issu onli a few dai befor clinton took offic it is a somewhat bland opaqu document a scrub mean unclassifi version of someth more candid but it contain the essenti idea of shape rather than react to the rest of the world and of prevent the rise of other superpow it tone is on of skeptic about diplomat partnership a more forthright version of the same idea can be found in a short book titl from contain to global leadership which zalmai khalilzad who join chenei s team in number and is now special envoi to afghanistan publish a coupl of year into the clinton administr when he wa out of govern it recommend that the unit state preclud the rise of anoth global rival for the indefinit futur khalilzad write it is a vital u s interest to preclud such a develop i e to be will to us forc if necessari for the purpos when georg w bush wa campaign for presid he and the peopl around him didn t seem to be propos a great doctrin shift along the line of the polici of contain of the soviet union s sphere of influenc which the unit state maintain dure the cold war in hi first major foreign polici speech deliv in novemb of number bush declar that a presid must be a clear ei realist a formul that seem to connot an absenc of world remak ambit realism is exactli the foreign polici doctrin that chenei s pentagon team reject partli becaus it posit the imposs of ani on countri s ever domin world affair for ani length of time on get mani remind in washington these dai of how much the terrorist attack of septemb numberth have chang offici foreign polici think ani chief execut of either parti would probabl have done what bush ha done so far made war on the taliban and al qaeda and enhanc domest secur it is onli now six month after the attack that we ar truli enter the realm of presidenti choic and all indic ar that bush is go to us septemb numberth as the occas to launch a new aggress american foreign polici that would repres a broad chang in direct rather than a specif war on terror all hi rhetor especi in the two address he ha given to joint session of congress sinc septemb numberth and all the inform about hi state of mind which hi aid have leak indic that he see thi as the nation s moment of destini a percept that the peopl around him seem to be encourag becaus it enhanc bush s statur and open the wai to more assert policymak insid govern the reason septemb numberth appear to have been a transform moment as the senior offici i had lunch with put it is not so much that it reveal the exist of a threat of which offici had previous been unawar as that it drastic reduc the american public s usual resist to american militari involv oversea at least for a while the clinton administr begin with the black hawk down oper in mogadishu dure it first year oper on the convict that american were highli avers to casualti the all bomb kosovo oper in clinton s next to last year wa the ideal foreign militari adventur now that the unit state ha been attack the option ar much broader the senior offici approvingli mention a number studi of casualti avers by the triangl institut for secur studi which argu that the mass public is much less casualti avers than the militari or the civilian lite believ for exampl the studi show that the public would toler thirti thousand death in a militari oper to prevent iraq from acquir weapon of mass destruct the american death total in the vietnam war wa about fifti eight thousand septemb numberth presum reduc casualti avers even further recent i went to the white hous to interview condoleezza rice rice s foreign affair articl from number begin with thi declar the unit state ha found it exceedingli difficult to defin it nation interest in the absenc of soviet power i ask her whether that is still the case i think the difficulti ha pass in defin a role she said immedi i think septemb numberth wa on of those great earthquak that clarifi and sharpen event ar in much sharper relief like bush she said that oppos terror and prevent the accumul of weapon of mass destruct in the hand of irrespons state now defin the nation interest the latter goal by the wai is new in bush s speech to congress on septemb numberth america s sole grand purpos wa end terror we talk in her west wing offic it tall window face the part of the white hous ground where televis report do their standup in her bear rice seem less crispli militari than she doe in public she look a littl tire but she wa project a kind of missionari calm rather than belliger in the foreign affair articl rice came across as a classic realist put forth the notion of power polit great power and power balanc as the proper central concern of the unit state now she sound as if she had move closer to the on power idea that chenei s pentagon team propos ten year ago or at least to the idea that the other great power ar now in harmoni with the unit state becaus of the terrorist attack and can be induc to remain so theoret the realist would predict that when you have a great power like the unit state it would not be long befor you had other great power rise to challeng it or try to balanc against it rice said and i think what you re see is that there s at least a predilect thi time to move to product and coper relat with the unit state rather than to try to balanc the unit state i actual think that statecraft matter in how it all come out it s not all foreordain rice said that she had call togeth the senior staff peopl of the nation secur council and ask them to think serious about how do you capit on these opportun to fundament chang american doctrin and the shape of the world in the wake of septemb numberth i realli think thi period is analog to number to number she said that is the period when the contain doctrin took shape in that the event so clearli demonstr that there is a big global threat and that it s a big global threat to a lot of countri that you would not have normal thought of as be in the coalit that ha start shift the tecton plate in intern polit and it s import to try to seiz on that and posit american interest and institut and all of that befor thei harden again the nation secur council is legal requir to produc an annual document call the nation secur strategi state the over all goal of american polici anoth govern report whose import is great but not obviou the bush administr did not produc on last year as the clinton administr did not in it first year rice said that she is work on the report now there ar two wai to handl thi document she told me on is to do it in a kind of minimalist wai and just get it out but it s our view that sinc thi is go to be the first on for the bush administr it s import an aw lot ha happen sinc we start thi process prior to number number i can t give you a certain date when it s go to be out but i would think sometim thi spring and it s import that it be a real statement of what the bush administr see as the strateg direct that it s go it seem clear alreadi that rice will set forth the hope of a more domin american role in the world than she might have a coupl of year ago some question that don t appear to be settl yet but ar obvious be ask ar how much the unit state is will to oper alon in foreign affair and how much chang it is will to try to engend insid other countri and to what end and with what mean the leak a coupl of week ago of a new american nuclear postur ad offens capabl against rogu state depart from decad of offici adher to a pure defens posit and wa just on indic of the scope of the reconsider that is go on is the unit state now in a posit to be redraw region map especi in the middl east and replac govern by forc nobodi thought that the bush administr would be think in such ambiti term but plainli it is and with the intern debat to the right of where it wa onli a few month ago just befor the number elect a republican foreign polici figur suggest to me that a good indic of a bush administr s direct in foreign affair would be who got a higher rank job paul wolfowitz or richard haass haass is anoth veteran of the first bush administr and an intellectu like wolfowitz but much more moder in number he publish a book titl the reluct sheriff in which he poke a littl fun at wolfowitz s famou strategi brief of the earli nineti he call it the pentagon paper and disagre with it idea that the unit state should try to be the world s onli great power over the long term for better or wors such a goal is beyond our reach haass wrote it simpli is not doabl elsewher in the book he disagre with anoth of the wolfowitz team s main idea that of the unit state expand the democrat zone of peac primaci is not to be confus with hegemoni the unit state cannot compel other to becom more democrat haass argu that the unit state is becom less domin in the world not more and suggest a reviv of what might be call tradit great power polit wolfowitz got a higher rank job than haass he is deputi secretari of defens and haass is director of polici plan for the state depart in effect colin powel s big think gui recent i went to see him in hi offic at the state depart on the wall of hi wait room wa an arrai of photograph of everi past director of the polici plan staff begin with georg kennan the father of the contain doctrin and the first holder of the offic that haass now occupi it s anoth indic of the wai thing ar move in washington that haass seem to have becom more hawkish i mention the titl of hi book us the word reluct wa itself reflect of a period when foreign polici seem secondari and sacrif for foreign polici wa a hard case to make he said it wa written when bill clinton wa sai it s the economi stupid not it s the world stupid two thing ar veri differ now on the presid ha a much easier time make the case that foreign polici matter second at the top of the nation secur chart is thi notion of weapon of mass destruct and terror i ask haass whether there is a doctrin emerg that is as broad as kennan s contain i think there is he said what you re see from thi administr is the emerg of a new principl or bodi of idea i m not sure it constitut a doctrin about what you might call the limit of sovereignti sovereignti entail oblig on is not to massacr your own peopl anoth is not to support terror in ani wai if a govern fail to meet these oblig then it forfeit some of the normal advantag of sovereignti includ the right to be left alon insid your own territori other govern includ the unit state gain the right to interven in the case of terror thi can even lead to a right of prevent or peremptori self defens you essenti can act in anticip if you have ground to think it s a question of when and not if you re go to be attack clearli haass wa think of iraq i don t think the american public need a lot of persuad about the evil that is saddam hussein he said also i d fulli expect the presid and hi chief lieuten to make the case public opinion can be chang we d be abl to make the case that thi isn t a discretionari action but on done in self defens on the larger issu of the american role in the world haass wa still maintain some distanc from the hawk he had made a speech not long befor call imperi america but he told me that there is a big differ between imperi and imperialist i just think that we have to be a littl bit care he said great as our advantag ar there ar still limit we have to have alli we can t impos our idea on everyon we don t want to be fight war alon so we need other to join us american leadership ye but not american unilater it ha to be multilater we can t win the war against terror alon we can t send forc everywher it realli doe have to be a collabor endeavor he stop for a moment is there a successor idea to contain i think there is he said it is the idea of integr the goal of u s foreign polici should be to persuad the other major power to sign on to certain kei idea as to how the world should oper opposit to terror and weapon of mass destruct support for free trade democraci market integr is about lock them into these polici and then build institut that lock them in even more the first but by no mean the last obviou manifest of a new american foreign polici will be the effort to remov saddam hussein what the unit state doe in an iraq oper will veri like dwarf what s been done so far in afghanistan both in term of the scale of the oper itself and in term of it aftermath sever week ago ahmad chalabi the head of the iraqi nation congress the iraqi opposit parti came through washington with an entourag of hi aid chalabi went to the state depart and the white hous to ask evid successfulli for more american fund hi main public event wa a panel discuss at the american enterpris institut chalabi s lead support in town richard perl the promin hawk and former defens depart offici act as moder smile and suprem confid perl open the discuss by sai evid is mount that the administr is look veri carefulli at strategi for deal with saddam hussein the war on terror he said will not be complet until saddam is successfulli dealt with and that mean replac hi regim that action will be taken i have no doubt chalabi who live in london is a charm suav middl ag man with a twinkl in hi ey he wa dress in a doubl breast pin stripe suit and a stripe shirt with a white spread collar although he and hi support argu that the iraqi nation congress with suffici american support can defeat saddam just as the northern allianc defeat the taliban in afghanistan thi view hasn t won over most peopl in washington it isn t just that chalabi doesn t look the part of a rebel militari leader he could fight you for the last petit four on the trai over tea at the savoi but that s about it on skeptic former pentagon offici told me or that he isn t in iraq it s also that saddam s militari is perhap ten time the size that the taliban s wa and ha been quit success at put down revolt over the last decad the unit state left iraq in number believ that saddam might soon fall to an intern rebellion chalabi s support believ that saddam is much weaker now and that even sign that a seriou oper wa in the of could finish him off but non true believ seem to be come around to the idea that a militari oper against saddam would mean the deploy of anywher from a hundr thousand to three hundr thousand american ground troop kenneth pollack a former c i a analyst who wa the nation secur council s staff expert on iraq dure the last year of the clinton administr recent caus a stir in the foreign polici world by publish an articl in foreign affair call for war against saddam thi wa noteworthi becaus three year ago pollack and two co author publish an articl also in foreign affair argu that the iraqi nation congress wa incap of defeat saddam pollack still doesn t think chalabi can do the job he believ that it would requir a substanti american ground air and sea forc closer in size to the on we us in kuwait in number number than to the on we ar us now in afghanistan pollack who is trim quick and crisp is obvious a man who ha given a brief or two in hi dai when i went to see him at hi offic in washington with a littl encourag he got out from behind hi desk and walk over to hi offic wall where three map of the middl east were hang the onli wai to do it is a full scale invas he said us a pen as a pointer we re talk about two grand corp two to three hundr thousand peopl altogeth the popul is here in the tigri euphrat vallei he point to the area between baghdad and basra ideal you d have the saudi on board he point to the princ sultan airbas near riyadh you could make kuwait the base but it s much easier in saudi you need to take western iraq and southern iraq point again becaus otherwis thei ll fire scud at israel and at the saudi oil field you probabl want to prevent iraq from blow up it own oil field so troop have to occupi them and you need troop to defend the kurd in northern iraq point point you go in as hard as you can as fast as you can he slap hi hand on the top of hi desk you get the enemi to divid hi forc by threaten him in two place at onc hi hand hit the desk again hard then you crush him smack that would be a reverber blow the unit state ha alreadi remov the govern of on countri afghanistan the new govern is obvious shaki and american militari oper there ar not complet pakistan which befor septemb numberth clearli met the new test of nation unaccept it both harbor terrorist and ha weapon of mass destruct will also requir long term attent sinc the countri is not wholli under the control of the govern as the murder of daniel pearl demonstr and even part of the govern like the intellig servic mai not be entir under the control of the presid in iraq if america invad and bring down saddam a new govern must be establish an enorm long term task in a countri where there is no obviou plausibl new leader the prospect iraq oper ha drawn strong object from the neighbor nation on of which russia is a nuclear superpow an invas would have a huge effect on the intern affair of all the biggest middl eastern nation iran turkei saudi arabia and even egypt event have forc the administr to becom directli involv in the isra palestinian conflict as it hadn t want to do so it s realli the entir region that is in plai in much the wai that europ wa immedi after the second world war in septemb bush reject paul wolfowitz s recommend of immedi move against iraq that the presid seem to have chang hi mind is an indic in part of the bureaucrat skill of the administr s conserv these gui ar relentless on former offici who is close to the high command at the state depart told me resist is futil the conserv other weapon besid relentless is intellectu colin powel tend to think case by case and sinc septemb numberth the conserv have outflank him by produc at least the begin of a coher hawkish world view whose accept practic requir invad iraq if the unit state appli the doctrin of chenei s old pentagon team shape and expand the zone of democraci the implic would extend far beyond that on oper the outsid expert on the middl east who have the most credibl with the administr seem to be bernard lewi of princeton and fouad ajami of the john hopkin school of advanc intern studi both of whom see the arab middl east as a region in need of radic remedi lewi wa invit to the white hous in decemb to brief the senior foreign polici staff on point he made is look in that part of the world noth matter more than resolut will and forc the senior offici i had lunch with told me in other word the unit state needn t proce gingerli for fear of inflam the arab street as long as it is prepar to be strong the senior offici also recommend as interest thinker on the middl east charl hill of yale who in a recent essai declar everi regim of the arab islam world ha prove a failur and reuel marc gerecht of the american enterpris institut who publish an articl in the weekli standard about the need for a chang of regim in iran and syria those goal gerecht told me when we spoke could be accomplish through pressur short of an invas sever peopl i spoke with predict that most or even all of the nation that loudli oppos an invas of iraq would privat cheer it on if thei felt certain that thi time the american were realli go to finish the job on purpos of vice presid chenei s recent diplomat tour of the region wa to offer assur on that matter while game absorb all the public critic of an iraq oper in ani event the administr appear to be commit to act forcefulli in advanc of the world s approv when i spoke to condoleezza rice she said that the unit state should assembl coalit of the will to support it action rather than feel it ha to work within the exist infrastructur of intern treati and organ an invas of iraq would test that polici in more wai than on the administr would be bet that it can continu to elimin al qaeda cell in countri that publicli oppos the iraq oper when the administr submit it budget earlier thi year it ask for a forti eight billion dollar increas in defens spend for fiscal number which begin in octob number much of that sum would go to improv militari pai and benefit but ten billion dollar of it is design as an unspecifi conting fund for further oper in the war on terror that s probabl at least the initi fund for an invas of iraq thi spring the administr will be talk to other countri about the invas try to secur base and overflight privileg while bush build up a rhetor case for it by give speech about the unaccept of develop weapon of mass destruct a drama involv weapon inspect in iraq will plai itself out over the spring and summer and will end with the unit state declar that the term that saddam offer for the inspect involv delai and restrict ar unaccept then probabl in the late summer or earli fall the enorm troop posit which will take month will begin the administr obvious feel confid that the unit state can effect parri whatev aggress action saddam take dure the troop buildup and hope that it move will destabil iraq enough to caus the republican guard the militari kei to the countri to turn against saddam and toppl him on it own but the chain of event lead inexor to a full scale american invas if it hasn t alreadi begun evid will begin soon lewi scooter libbi who wa the princip drafter of chenei s futur of the world document dure the first bush administr now work in an offic in the old execut offic build overlook the west wing where he ha a second smaller offic a packet of public relat materi prompt by the recent paperback public of hi number novel the apprentic quot the time call him dick chenei s dick chenei which seem like an apt descript he appear absolut sure of himself and whether by coincid or as a result of the influenc of hi boss speak in a tough confidenti gravelli rumbl like condoleezza rice and bush himself he give the impress of have calmli accept the idea that the project of war and reconstruct which the administr ha now taken on mai be a littl exhaust for those charg with carri it out but is unquestion right the onli truli prudent cours when i went to see libbi not long ago i ask him whether befor septemb numberth american polici toward terror should have been differ he went to hi desk and got out a larg black loos leaf binder fill with typewritten sheet interspers with foldout map of the middl east he look through it for a long minut formul hi answer let us stack it up he said at last somalia number number the discoveri of the al qaeda relat plot in the philippin number the world trade center first bomb number the attempt to assassin presid bush former presid bush and the lack of respons to that the lack of a seriou respons to that number the riyadh bomb number the khobar bomb number the kenyan embassi bomb and the tanzanian embassi bomb number the plot to launch millennium attack number the bomb of the cole throughout thi period infract on inspect by the iraqi and eventu the withdraw of the entir inspect regim and the failur to respond significantli to iraqi incurs in the kurdish area no on would sai these challeng pose easi problem but if you take that long list and you ask did we respond in a wai which discourag peopl from support terrorist activ or activ clearli against our interest did we help to shape the environ in a wai which discourag further aggress against u s interest mani observ conclud no and ask whether it wa then easier for someon like osama bin laden to rise up and sai credibl the american don t have the stomach to defend themselv thei won t take casualti to defend their interest thei ar moral weak libbi insist that the american respons to septemb numberth ha not been standard or foreordain look at what the presid ha done in afghanistan he said and look at hi speech to the joint session of congress mean the state of the union messag in januari he made it clear that it s an import area he made it clear that we believ in expand the zone of democraci even in thi difficult part of the world he made it clear that we stand by our friend and defend our interest and he had the courag to identifi those state which present a problem and to begin to build consensu for action that would need to be taken if there is not a chang of behavior on their part take the afghan case for exampl there ar mani other cours that the presid could have taken he could have wait for jurid proof befor we respond he could have engag in long negoti with the taliban he could have fail to seek a new relationship with pakistan base on it past nuclear test or been so afraid of weaken pakistan that we didn t seek it help thi list could go on to twice or three time the length i ve mention so far but instead the presid saw an opportun to refashion relat while stand up for our interest the problem is complex and we don t know yet how it will end but we have open new prospect for relat not onli with afghanistan as import as it wa as a threat but with the state of central asia pakistan russia and as it mai develop with the state of southwest asia more gener we move on to iraq and the question of what make saddam hussein unaccept in the administr s ey the issu is not inspect libbi said the issu is the iraqi promis not to have weapon of mass destruct their promis to recogn the boundari of kuwait their promis not to threaten other countri and other promis that thei made in number and a number of u n resolut includ all the other problem i list whether it wa wise or not and that is the subject of debat iraq wa given a second chanc to abid by intern norm it fail to take that chanc then and annual for the next ten year what s your level of confid i ask him that the current regim will in fact chang it behavior in a wai that you will be satisfi by he ran hi hand over hi face and then gave me a
