 and sai hello to the cool oooo thi is go to caus some stir httpaddr receiv via httpaddr us satellit to monitor global climat chang earth system scienc laboratori the univers of alabama in huntsvil for addit inform dr john christi associ professor of atmospher scienc earth system scienc laboratori the univers of alabama in huntsvil phone number number number e mail emailaddr dr roi spencer space scientist global hydrolog climat center nasa marshal space flight center phone number number number e mail emailaddr summari as part of an ongo nasa uah joint project dr john christi of uah and dr roi spencer of nasa s marshal space flight center us data gather by microwav sound unit msu on nation ocean and atmospher administr tiro n satellit to get accur direct measur of atmospher temperatur for almost all region of the earth includ remot desert rain forest and ocean for which reliabl temperatur data ar not otherwis avail the accuraci and reliabl of temperatur data gather by the satellit sinc januari number ha been confirm by compar the satellit data to independ temperatur data a recent studi number found a number percent agreement between the msu data and temperatur measur by thermomet suspend beneath weather balloon releas by meteorologist for weather observ onc the monthli temperatur data is collect from the satellit and process it is place in a public comput file for immedi access by atmospher scientist in the u s and abroad it ha becom the basi for a number of major studi in global climat chang and is cite in report from the intergovernment panel on climat chang gather the data while tradit thermomet measur the temperatur at a specif point in the air a microwav sound unit on a satellit take read that ar averag temperatur in a huge volum of the atmospher each of the more than number number read per dai per satellit is an averag temperatur for more than number number cubic kilomet of air the msu make a direct measur of the temperatur by look at microwav emit by oxygen molecul in the atmospher the intens of the microwav emiss their bright vari accord to temperatur christi and spencer develop a method to take the data from sever satellit and produc a unifi temperatur dataset verifi the accuraci of msu measur a recent comparison number of temperatur read from two major climat monitor system microwav sound unit on satellit and thermomet suspend below helium balloon found a remark level of agreement between the two to verifi the accuraci of temperatur data collect by microwav sound unit christi compar temperatur read record by radiosond thermomet to temperatur report by the satellit as thei orbit over the balloon launch site he found a number percent correl over the number year period of the studi the overal composit temperatur trend at those site agre to within number number degre celsiu about number number fahrenheit per decad the same result were found when consid onli station in the polar or arctic region the idea wa to determin the reliabl of the satellit data by compar it to an establish independ measur christi said if satellit data ar reliabl when the satellit ar over the radiosond site that mean you should be abl to trust them everywher els the number radiosond report an aggreg warm trend of number number degre celsiu about number number fahrenheit per decad sinc number over those number spot on the globe the satellit also record a warm trend number number degre celsiu about number number fahrenheit per decad global howev the satellit data show a cool trend of number number degre celsiu per decad sinc the first noaa tiro n satellit went into servic these number radiosond launch site ar just not distribut evenli around the planet christi said thei ar not repres of the total globe radiosond balloon ar releas from station around the world usual at noon and midnight greenwich standard time as each balloon climb from the surfac to the stratospher the temperatur is measur and relai to the ground by radio while there ar more than number number radiosond launch site global the data from mani site either ar not readili avail or ar not consist collect christi us data from number site at which there ha been long term systemat and reliabl data collect these number radiosond launch site ar in a box bound by iceland trinidad truk island and alaska in an earlier studi an upper air temperatur record compil by noaa from number daili weather balloon site around the world indic a number year climat trend of number number c per decad which wa in exact agreement with the satellit data at that time christi said global coverag on advantag of the msu dataset is it global coverag microwav sound unit aboard noaa satellit directli measur the temperatur of the atmospher over more than number percent of the globe each satellit measur the temperatur abov most point on earth everi number hour the global temperatur that ha been frequent report from surfac measur is neither global in extent nor systemat in measur method it neglect vast ocean and continent region includ antarctica the brazilian rain forest the sahara desert and greenland the most commonli cite histor temperatur dataset is from ground base thermomet more than number number thermomet worldwid provid almost instantan local temperatur data through link to weather servic and scientist most of these thermomet which ar usual in small shelter about five feet abov the ground ar in area easili access to peopl in the u s and other industri countri these thermomet ar most often found at airport the ground base network is extens in north america europ russia china and japan it is less comprehens in africa south america australia and across much of southern asia temperatur on the surfac and vertic through the atmospher ar gather daili by thermomet carri aloft by helium balloon radiosond balloon ar releas from station around the world usual at noon and midnight greenwich standard time while balloon releas site ar scatter throughout the world thei ar concentr in industri nation there ar more than number number radiosond launch site global if thei were evenli distribut around the world that would equal approxim on for everi number number squar mile of the earth s surfac water temperatur which ar us to deriv estim of atmospher temperatur come from thermomet on pier and buoi and aboard ship of opportun the ship record the temperatur of water drawn in to cool their engin the water temperatur data from these instrument is also not global in it coverag tend instead to be concentr in heavili travel ship lane and in harbor in the past number year a new system of approxim number deep ocean buoi ha been establish gather both atmospher and water temperatur data instrument accuraci msu with nine satellit measur the temperatur over period of from on to six year a method wa devis to merg all the data into a singl consist time seri each satellit ha it own bia that if not calcul and remov would introduc spuriou trend the bias ar calcul by directli compar each satellit with other in oper at that time period of overlap oper rang from three month to three year and were suffici to determin these bias becaus the msu instrument ar so stabl and have so mani thousand of observ the bias between the satellit ar known to within number number deg the final product remov these bias so that all data ar referenc to a common base number to check the final product comparison were made over a number year period with balloon measur as state abov and the phenomen agreement provid the independ valid necessari to conclud that the merg techniqu develop for thi dataset wa accur instrument accuraci ground base thermomet of great concern to scientist is the lack of consist in the wai read ar taken and in the thermomet surround sinc most thermomet for which long term record exist ar in town and citi the effect of popul growth and the construct of nearbi road park lot runwai and build mai caus the temperatur to rise a littl due of urban thi temperatur chang mai be an artifact of a local asphalt effect rather than a long term widespread climat chang instrument accuraci ship of opportun while the temperatur data collect by ship at sea is report as a sea surfac temperatur thi data reflect water temperatur from about three to number feet below the surfac the level from which water is drawn into the ship the thousand of individu thermomet us to collect thi data ar not calibr against a scientif standard nor is there a method for verifi the accuraci of either the thermomet or the report match temperatur read to specif time and place onli in place where there ar mani overlap observ can there be ani confid in their accuraci the scientist in number spencer and christi receiv the american
