 all els be equal the termin veloc is invers proport to the squar root of air densiti air densiti drop off pretti quickli and i realli should be do someth other than dig up the math for that i think it involv calculu to integr the amount of mass as the column of the atmospher trail off chemistri type have a method for deal with thi question without drag in the calculu suppos an atmospher to be mainli affect by graviti result in the potenti energi for a mass m to be linear in height h mgh what rel concentr will we have when two differ packet of air ar in equilibrium if thei ar at the same height we will have half the mass in on and half the mass in the other and the amount flow from on to the other balanc the amount flow in the opposit direct number if thei ar at differ height then a greater percentag of the higher air tend to descend than that percentag of the lower air which ascend in order for the two flow to balanc the higher packet must contain less air than the lower and the mass balanc of the flow correspond thusli high percentag of thin air low percentag of dens air now rate ar exponenti in energi differ number so that theoret we should expect an exponenti decai in height to compens how doe it go in practic dave number how well doe it balanc chemic equilibria seem stabl as thei deal with veri larg number over a veri long time econom equilibria ar view from the mayfli standpoint of individu peopl and so at best the shot nois is veri visibl number that is to sai rate will be exponenti in the free energi differ between endpoint and a transit state we can ignor that complic in thi model
