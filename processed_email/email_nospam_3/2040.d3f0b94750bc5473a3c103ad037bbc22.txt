 url httpaddr date not suppli we re try to decid if fogbugz number number number should support custom field histor i am oppos to custom field in principl becaus thei get abus peopl add so mani field to their bug databas to captur everyth thei think might be import that enter a bug is like appli to harvard end result peopl don t enter bug which is much much wors than not captur all that inform you can alwai page fault to get the inform if the origin report forgot it rather than have a field in everi bug where you enter the version number of everi dll on your machin thi is an actual custom request inform which is like to be relev onli for a tini percentag of bug why not just have the programm assigne look at the bug first and if thei think it might be dll version relat onli then bounc the bug back to the origin ask for the dll info similarli it s alwai tempt to add a field in which you ask for the os version in which the bug occur thi sound logic but trust me ad field like thi is guarante to do on thing and on thing onli reduc the number of bug report that get into the system in the first place onli a small percentag of bug ar realli os depend and you can alwai includ that info in the text descript of the bug if it happen to be relev but then how do you search for sai all bug which onli happen on window numbers aha you can t ever even with the custom field becaus not everi bug ha been regress on everi version of everi oper system so thi search doesn t make sens in the first place the info wasn t captur do a full text search for numbers and you ll find some of them life is imperfect life would be more perfect if everi bug report includ megabyt of inform a complet dump of everi byte on the hard drive and in ram on the comput in question and while you re at it a photograph of the tester s workspac but the goal of a bug track databas is to keep track of bug which all els be equal take prioriti over make it easi to find them i have heard countless stori of develop team where the bug track packag wa so high ceremoni that peopl were afraid to enter bug in the system becaus thei didn t know what all those field were the real bug track happen in email post it and hallwai convers great a pretti common question we get on the custom servic line is doe fogbugz support custom field rather than give our usual answer no on purpos over the last few week i ve been sai can you pleas tell me what field you would need we re try to decid whether to implement that featur in number number and we want to know why peopl need it the interest thing is almost all of the field peopl ask for ar alreadi in fogbugz and the other on in my educ opinion shouldn t be field and in fact our exist custom ar certainli happi without custom field on of our biggest site licens wa sold to a semiconductor compani and i myself want to add a custom field for them to keep track of version of the circuit design but i didn t and thei never need it even though thei had been keep track of it with the old bug track packag which had custom field and thei ar happi and keep bui more site licens but the dilemma for us is that mani custom ar evalu bug track softwar and thei consid the lack of custom field to be a major weak in our product gosh even filemak ha custom field righto it s true and who am i to tell my custom thei ar wrong on person who i wa talk to yesterdai would have us a custom field for someth that we alreadi have a built in field for thi would have made their databas confus and inconsist and would have definit caus more problem than it solv but it s still rude of me to tell custom that we don t have that featur for their own good even though it usual is and we re lose some sale becaus of it sigh i guess we could have a custom field featur but hide it and make it so hard to us that peopl don t us it at least we won t lose ani sale number httpaddr
