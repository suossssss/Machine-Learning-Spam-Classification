 on wed number number number at number number frank bergmann wrote a more reason explic of the eu us differ accord to some american journalist cite in a german magazin can someon help me is that the american public perceiv the rest of the world basic as a thread against which you have to defend yourself us power thi is not a correct assess the american public couldn t care less howev the us intellig commun correctli perceiv a threat and it isn t the third world mani european and other develop nation aggress engag in covert oper against american interest it been go on for year and isn t even new thing have step up in recent year and the us dod is none too pleas for better or wors the us is rel good at that game too as with most backwat war thei ar proxi for the interest of the big player find a current list of the top intellig threat to the us you ll find that half the countri on that list ar european most peopl ar unawar of how aggress these thing have gotten in recent year on the other hand the european ar us to the peac of their cozi post war system where extern secur is not an issu all secur thread can be resolv by give monei to the threaten peopl and to integr them into the wealthi sphere balkan palestinian bullshit the european govern ruthlessli suppress real opposit obvious some more than other us specop ar often brought in to do dirti work insid europ for european govern usual with govern advisor along for the mission i ve alwai wonder what the deal wa such that we got involv at all the point be that we ve act as assassin for european govern insid their border against their own citizen under the auspic of those govern and in recent year not ancient histori i know specop gui who left the militari specif becaus of the circumst of some of these mission while thei were post for that duti i m certainli glad i wa never assign mission in that theater becaus there is a lot of covert nasti go on in nomin friendli european democraci regardless give monei to peopl that threaten you ha never creat meaning peac in the histori of civil we call it extort under ani other guis a lot of the current eu us issu can be explain by thi differ of percept such as the current american unilater nobodi want to help us the american arrog toward europ thei don t want to do anyth so why should we ask them and the grow reject of the american polici in europ thei want to abolish the law europ is look increasingli like a basket case whatev problem the us is have these dai europ look wors and is go downhil faster why the us would want to emul european behavior or the european wai of do thing is beyond me the us ask for major polici advic from europ is like ask a quack for medic advic i realli don t see what is wrong with unilater anywai why should anyon join a stamped that is head for a cliff i hope the incess knee jerk conformist screech that american see come from europ doesn t actual repres the view of european for variou reason i m not exactli a cheerlead for the us govern but the premis of the argument against them here ar lame my person point is that few american percentag of overal popul have ever left their countri while even german construct worker regularli spend their holidai in spain so i m not surpris that paranoia is grow i m bet you ar underestim the actual percentag the vast major of peopl i know have live work and travel outsid the countri at on time or anoth and i doubt european have travel anywher near as much in the western hemispher as american have despit the best effort of franc europ is still not the center of the univers i ll throw you a bone though most american do consid europ to be drift into irrelev and therefor ignor it but from the perspect of an american how could you not look at it thi wai the impact of europ on america ha diminish greatli over the year i love the smell of euro chauvin in the morn first you assum that the north american contin is ethnic and cultur homogen anybodi that ha actual travel throughout north america know thi isn t true there ar more than five major and veri distinct cultur and societi in the us alon never mind the hundr of divers region sub popul some of which ar truli foreign appar european confus speak the same languag with have the same cultur that would be like sai mexico is cultur ident to spain becaus thei nomin speak the same languag a wyom rancher ha almost noth in common cultur or social with your averag person live in san francisco despit speak the same languag and nomin live in the same countri if i want to visit a wildli differ cultur for the holidai i ll go to oakland new orlean or similar thei ar far more differ from where i live than some countri i ve travel to and a lot of these place ar farther from where i live than spain is from germani second the state i live in is the size of germani when i travel to a neighbor state which i do regularli how is thi not equival in fact i probabl travel much farther for the holidai than your german construct worker if you look at the eu as a singl countri onli then doe your analog becom compar what kind of ridicul superior do european get from have rel tini countri in truth i find europ to be about as cultur homogen as the us there ar a lot of cultur similar across the eu with rel minor local deviat that vari with distanc in wai veri similar to the us the onli real differ is that european have dozen of differ languag which is hardli someth i would call an advantag although there ar a coupl part of the us where i can t understand a word thei ar sai either jame
