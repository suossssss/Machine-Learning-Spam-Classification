 i have some patch that seem to fix avoid thi problem now it is amaz what on can achiev when main power fail long enough for up s to run out and all that is left oper is the laptop and it batteri suppli first i put in some defens code into the area where the problem wa occur so that if exmh is attempt for ani reason to expand a sequenc that isn t either a number or a rang of number or a list of such thing it will simpli ignor the trash rather than give a traceback thi on solv the initi problem mh tcl wasthu aug number number number number number mh tclwed aug number number number number number number number number number set seq set rseq foreach rang split string trim dollarsequ if regexp number number number number dollar dollarrang just ignor anyth bogu continu set part split string trim dollarrang if llength dollarpart number lappend seq dollarpart that is amend proc mhseqexpand which is where the error wa occur befor the code assum that dollarrang is either nnn or nnn mmm so we should probabl make sure that s true issu an error instead of just continu if you like but i don t think an error is need but that just allow me to creat a similar problem in anoth place by type nnn and rather than continu to fight fire like thi i thought i should think more about brent s suggest but rather than have the select code actual valid the input which would mean it would have to know what is to be valid i decid that the right thing to do is just to ignor ani error caus by invalid input so i just stuck a catch around the msgshow that is process the nonsens that the user ha type thi wai ani later expans to what msgshow treat as legal mayb allow a sequenc name like prev or next or anyth els can be handl just there without someon need to rememb that thei have to go fix the select process code to allow it but while i wa plai there i notic someth i never new befor if you type number the number chang to number and so on for each that is type i suspect that s perhap an artifact of is bound to a differ function so it can be us as a toggl between chang the current and the target folder but it ha to mean someth if the current input mode is a messag number so let it mean but now i found it i think it nice but if we can type number why not number as well that kind of limit bug me so i fix it and then i wonder about folder with name contain the special us of as the toggl charact mean there s no wai to type those from the keyboard so i fix that as well thi make two differ restrict there s no wai to type a folder name that ha a name begin with but such a thing in mh would be a pain to us anywai so i doubt thi will bother anyon and it is now onli possibl to toggl between type the current target folder name when the name be type is empti i m less happi about that part but i think i can live with it in order to allow folder name with s in them to exist and be type then sinc i wa there anywai i decid to do someth about anoth featur that ha alwai bug me in normal keyboard mode s is the kei us to show a messag but if you ve just type number and the ftoc is highlight number as the current messag and you want to now show that messag you can t type s you have to type r instead so i fix thi on as well fix here is in quot as it assum that the keybind for msgshow is s if you chang that to someth els it will remain s in here i don t know enough tk tcl to have it discov what kei is bound to a function in the extern world in order to bind the same on here r continu to work of cours and now i got start in fix irrit in thi code i also made it clear the statu line if you abort messag folder entri mode c or g previous it us to leav the prompt sit there until the next messag appear which made it less than obviou that the keyboard had revert to it usual bind in ani case what follow is the patch that doe all of that i believ that if you appli thi then the on abov is probabl not need the catch around the msgshow will hide the problem i don t think we realli need to fix brent s wai of invok it or includ it anywai just for complet i haven t run an exmh with the follow patch but not the previou on so i don t know for sure that all will be ok then kre
