 the histor record by which you mean human histor record is highli overr nigh worthless when you ar talk about geolog timescal even on topic with as short a timescal as climat there ha been a signific recent increas in global conumb concentr the vast preponder of the new conumb in the atmospher is due to human activ start around the industri of europ and acceler after wwii most scientist studi global climat chang believ that these increas conumb concentr ar the primari causal agent for increas global warm henc our interest in item of human time scale it is worth note that underneath the reced glacier deposit dure the last major ic ag thei ar find substanti evid of human live in what wa a nice temper climat befor the glacier pave over their civil the reced glacier have turn into a bit of an archaeolog treasur chest as thei expos artifact buri in and underneath them as thei shrink that have been preserv by the ic for thousand of year i don t see ani compel reason to save the glacier anywai particularli in light of the fact that their exist ha alwai been transient most global climat chang scientist would agre that temperatur in the past have often been much warmer than todai the point of global warm isn t to save the earth the planet is not sentient the point is to understand and potenti reduc the impact of increas temperatur on global human activ for anyon to insist that the current neglig fluctuat ar anthropogen just heap on ridicul assert upon anoth i ll just stick with occam s razor for now the increas in atmospher conumb concentr is due to human activ it is gener accept that increas in conumb in a close environ subject to solar heat retain more of that solar energi thi is the current best explan for the high temperatur of venu if the conumb concentr goe up global which it ha then theori state the earth should be retain greater solar energi thi process mai be slow and mai be difficult to monitor due to the variabl of temperatur worldwid i encourag you to refut ani part of thi causal chain link conumb to eventu increas in global energi content part of which will be evid as heat jim
