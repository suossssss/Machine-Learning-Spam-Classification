 xvid number is a project to make gpl divx codec sigma design number is a compani look to put out hardwar to playback amongst other thing divx file problem is sigma is us xvid gpled code in wai not veri gpl the result xvid stop work on thier code and ask the user to put preasur on sigma to honor the gpl some note from other place from doomnumb number xvid develop ha been stop the sigma design realmag mpeg number video codec contain wide portion of code taken from the xvid project soon after the initi releas of the realmag codec the xvid develop have contact sigma and inform them about the gpl violat for those who don t know xvid is distribut under the gnu public licens gpl which demand that if you modifi a gpl program you have to releas it under the gpl which in thi case mean that the sourc code of the sigma codec must be freeli avail sigma promis to replac the stolen code but the new version of the codec which wa releas thi month onli disguis the stolen code it wa not actual remov sigma wa onc again contact and ask to remov the offend code but until todai noth ha happen therefor the xvid team is now turn to the public in the hope to receiv wide public support in their effort to convinc sigma design to respect the term of the gpl and until the matter ha been resolv xvid develop will not continu that be said i hope all the forum member who saw their thread about the sigma codec be close will understand our motiv now intern we alreadi knew what wa go on but sinc the xvid author first want to try and resolv thi intern we respect their wish and kept quiet about the matter at hand updat sigma ha issu a press releas announc the avail of the sourc code of their mpeg number codec and it s alreadi up for download howev not a word wa lost about the xvid issu and the press releas make on think that the sigma codec wa entir develop by sigma so we might be hear more about thi updat i found a gpl notic in some of the sourc code file but it also look like sigma place their own copyright line there and xvid doesn t get ani credit in the sourc either the gpl notic also collid with sigma s softwar licens agreement that you have to sign befor download codec or sourc on on the same issu divxnetwork said thei d fulli support xvid in thi issu and appar dxn s relationship with sigma didn t realli work out either as sigma s xcard is not as divx compat as it wa advertis updat first an updat on the xvid situat the releas of the sigma sourc code doe not mean it s all over it s far from be over the licens agreement which you have to agre to befor you can download and instal the codec is not compat with the gpl furthermor it can now clearli be seen download the sourc code and have a look for yourself that the sigma codec is pretti much a copi of the xvid codec but all the copyright notic of the origin develop have been remov and replac thi doe not onli violat the gpl but copyright law you can t just take a program chang a few line and chang the copyright statement you onli have copyright protect for the part you wrote on your own and relat to thi the sigma codec also contain code taken from the opendivx project the file were outfit with number differ copyright notic which is quit funni number httpaddr number httpaddr number httpaddr httpaddr
