 ok let s bring some data into the discuss httpaddr a graph deriv from vostok ic core sampl of conumb and temperatur fluctuat over the past numberk year recent high resolut studi of histor conumb concentr and temperatur over hundr of thousand of year have shown a modest correl between the two in a number of case conumb level increas ar not in phase with temperatur increas and actual trail the increas in temperatur by a short time i e increas in temperatur preced increas in conumb concentr the more studi that ar done of the geolog record the more it seem that conumb concentr ar correl with temperatur increas but ar not significantli caus base on the vostok data you ar right there is a veri strong correl between temperatur and conumb concentr but it doesn t alwai appear to be causal with respect to absolut conumb concentr it is also import to point out that our best data to date suggest that thei follow a fairli regular cycl with a period of about number number year also correct the peak of each cycl is at about number number ppm conumb as it happen current conumb concentr ar within number of other previou cyclic concentr peak for which we have good data not correct mauna loa data and show that the current conumb concentr ar at numberppm number greater than the highest record valu from the past numberk year furthermor conumb concentr ar grow at numberppm everi number year much faster than ani record increas in the vostok data though perhap the vostok data isn t capabl of such fine resolut in other word we mai be ad to the conumb level no we ar definit ad to conumb level look at the follow chart httpaddr show conumb concentr sinc number the histor record not onli is the conumb increas over number year unpreced in the vostok record it is clear that the rate of chang is increas not decreas there is no other compel explan for thi increas except for anthropogen input you re realli out on the fring if you re debat thi even global warm skeptic gener conced thi point but it look a lot like we would be build a molehil on top of a mountain in the histor record at the veri least there is noth anomal about current conumb concentr wrong again current conumb level ar current unpreced over the past numberk year unless there is some mechan that allow conumb level to quickli spike and then return back to normal background level and henc the spike might not show up in the ic core still by around number number we will have reach number ppm conumb a level that even you would have a hard time argu awai also conumb level interact with the biospher in a manner that ultim affect temperatur again the interact is not entir predict but thi is believ to be on of the regul neg feedback system mention abov ye cloud and ocean ar a big unknown still we know ocean water ha a finit capac to store conumb and if the world temperatur doesn t increas but we all have seattl like weather all the time the effect would be enorm last as greenhous gase go conumb isn t particularli potent although it make up for it in volum in some case gase such as water and methan have a far greater impact as greenhous gase on a per molecul basi water vapor mai actual be the kei greenhous ga someth that conumb onli indirectli effect through it interact with the biospher correct data on rel contribut of greenhous gass httpaddr note that methan concentr now ar much higher than pre industri level mani cow fart and rice paddi outgass and methan is also a contributor in the format of atmospher water vapor anoth clearli anthropogen increas in a greenhous ga i m in favor of reduct in methan level as well data on water vapor here httpaddr conumb wa an easi mark for earli environment but all the recent studi and data i ve seen give me the impress that it is larg a passeng on the climat ride rather than the driver i tend to think that holist and techic approach would work best in reduc global warm i favor an energi polici that ha a mix of solar wind and nuclear with all carbon base combust us renew sourc of c h bond aggress pursuit of carbon sink strategi also make sens buri tree deep underground for exampl approach that involv reduct in lifestyl to a sustain level ar unrealist american just won t do it you d be surpris at the number of climat chang research drive suv but as california show dure last year s energi crisi shift in pattern of consumpt ar possibl and improv effici is an easi sell jim
