 so then tim peter is all like guido i don t know how big that pickl would be mayb load it each time is fine or mayb marshal my test train on about number number msg and a binari pickl of the databas is approach number million byte my paltri number messag train set make a number numbermb where numbermb numberenumb byte pickl hammi py which i just check in will option let you write stuff out to a dbm file with that same messag base the dbm file weigh in at a hefti number numbermb it also take longer to write us a databas real numbermnumb number user numbermnumb number sy numbermnumb number us a pickl real numbermnumb number user numbermnumb number sy numbermnumb number thi is on a piii at number numbermhz i don t know what it s suppos to be number number is what proc cpuinfo sai for comparison spamoracl current the gold standard in my mind at least for speed on the same data blaze along real numbermnumb number user numbermnumb number sy numbermnumb number it data file which appear to be a marshal hash is numberkb howev it s compil o caml and it us a much simpler token algorithm written with a lexic analyz ocamllex so we ll never be abl to outperform it it s someth to keep in mind though i don t have statist yet for scan unknown messag actual i do and the databas blow the pickl out of the water but it score everi word with number number so i m not sure that s a fair test in ani case numbermb per user is probabl too larg and numbermb is question on the other hand my pickl compress veri well with gzip shrink down to number numbermb neal
