 i can t believ i actual read a laugh out loud funni profil of the fcc commission fer crissak so the follow articl come recommend a fine explan of michael powel s extraordinari equivoc on the other hand i can also agre with werbach s werblog entri rohit a trip to f c c world nichola lemann ha a piec in the new yorker thi week about fcc chairman michael powel it s on of the first articl i ve seen that captur some of powel s real person and the wai he s view in washington unfortun lemann end by endors convent polit wisdom after describ how powel isn t realli a fire breath ideolog conserv he conclud that in essenc powel favor the inumb local bell telephon compani while a democrat fcc would favor new entrant i know that s not how powel see the world and though i disagre with him on mani issu i think he s right to resist the old dichotomi the telecom collaps should be a humbl experi for anyon who went through it the disast wasn t the regul fault as some conserv argu but someth clearli went horribl wrong and polici maker should learn from that experi contrari to lemann s specul the upstart carrier won t be success in a gore administr becaus it s too late virtual all of them ar dead and wall street ha turn off the capit tap for the forese futur some mai surviv but as small player rather than world domin the battl between clec and rboc that lemann so astut parodi is old new the next import battl in telecom will be between those who want to stai within the tradit box and those who us differ model entir that s why open broadband network and open spectrum ar so import whatev the regulatori environ there is go to be consolid in telecom those left out in that consolid will face increas pressur to creat new pipe into the home or slowli die the victor in the consolid game will cut back on innov and rais price which will creat further pressur for altern lemann is right that polici make look much drier and more ambigu on the ground than through the len of histori but he s wrong in think that telecom s futur will be someth like it past fridai octob number number number number number am comment number httpaddr the chairman by nichola lemann he s the other powel and no

presid f c c world mai have been con tentiou but it wa settl too becaus all the reason power player had creat secur econom nich for themselv then in the nineteen eighti the success breakup of a t t by far the biggest and most import compani the commiss regulateddeposit a thick addit sediment of self confid onto the conscious of f c c world a gener ago for most american there wa on local phone compani on long distanc compani and on compani that manufactur telephon which custom were not permit to ownand thei were all the same compani it wa illeg to plug ani devic into a phone line by the mid nineteen nineti there were a dozen econom viabl local phone compani a hand of nation long distanc compani compet to offer custom the lowest price and best servic and store everywher sell telephon equip from mani manufacturersand million of american had a fax machin and a modem oper over the telephon line a t t had argu for year that it wa a natur monopoli requir protect from econom competit and total control over it line so much for that argument over the same period the f c c had assist in the birth of cabl televis and cell phone and the internet it wa the dream of feder agenc success come true consum vastli better serv and the industri much bigger and more prosper too the next big step wa suppos to be the telecommun act of number on of those massiv endlessli lobbi over piec of legisl which most peopl outsid f c c world probabl felt it wa safe to ignor although the telecom act sail under the rhetor banner of modern and deregul it essenc wa a grand interest group bargain in which the local phone compani known to headlin writer as babi bell and to f c c world as arbock the pronounc version of rboc or region bell oper compani would be permit to offer long distanc servic in exchang for let the long distanc compani and smaller new phone compani us their line to compet for custom consum would win becaus for the first time thei would get the benefit of competit in local servic while get even more competit than thei alreadi had in long distanc but the polit and econom of the telecom act which wa shepherd through congress by vice presid gore were just as import democrat saw the act as help to reposit them as the technolog partyth parti that brought the internet into everi home creat hundr of thousand of job in new compani and not least set off an invest boom whose beneficiari might becom the parti s new contributor base clinton s slogan about the inform superhighwai and build a bridg to the twenti first centuri which like all clinton slogan artfulli sent differ messag to differ constitu were the rhetor correl of the telecom act and gore s cruis to the presid wa suppos to be power substanti by the act s success the f c c had a crucial role in all thi the arbock ar rich aggress polit power and gener republican though like all import interest group thei work with both parti thei immedi file lawsuit which wound up ty the hand of their new competitor in the local phone market for more than three year through rule make enforc and litig the f c c then head by reed hundt who wa gore s classmat at st alban wa suppos to keep the arbock in their cage so that not onli long distanc compani like a t t and mci worldcom but also a whole categori of new compani see leck the pronounc version of clec or competit local exchang carrier could emerg thi entail the regulatori equival of hand to hand combat the see leck is suppos to have access to the arbock s switch equip the arbock won t give the seeleck a kei to the room where it s kept so the see leck ask the f c c to rule that the arbock ha to give it the kei partli becaus hundt assur the see leck and other new compani that he would protect them and partli becaus of the gener boom condit of the economi then invest capit flood into the see leckscompani with name like winstar covad and teligentand into other telecommun compani even not obvious relat technolog compani like cisco system benefit from the telecom boom demand for their product wa suppos to come from the see leck and other new player there would be no conflict between the interest of the new telecom compani and those of consum as on of hundt s former lieuten told me reed us to joke that my job wa to make sure that all price went down and all stock went up the year follow the passag of the telecom act were the peak of the boom wall street had it blood up and that meant not just more startup but also more merger of exist commun compani time warner and aol decid to throw in togeth and a t t and comcast and so on sure worldcom and the other telecom bad gui believ that their self deal stock oversel and creativ account would go unnot becaus the market wa so undiscrimin by the time the outcom of the number presidenti elect had been determin the telecom crash wa well under wai nonetheless the chairmanship of the f c c remain on of the best job in term of influenc and visibl avail to a career govern regul three republican emerg as candid powel who wa a commission harold furchtgott roth the farthest to the right commission and patrick wood the head of the texa public util commiss and as such a georg w bush gui in texa howev wood had cross the most power person in the arbock camp edward whitacr the c e o of s b c commun which is headquart in san antonio thi meant that the arbock didn t want wood as head of the f c c becaus he might be too pro see leck wood is now the head of the feder energi regulatori commiss michael powel had to signal the arbock that he wasn t as threaten as wood while also signal the conserv movement that he wa onli neglig farther to the left than furchtgott roth powel did thi deftli for exampl in decemb of number he appear befor a conserv group call the progress freedom foundat and gave a veri michael powel speechwhims intellectu and free associ biblic histori joseph schumpet moor s law that began by make fun of the idea that the f c c should try to keep new telecom compani aliv in the wake of the number act the f c c is often cast as the grinch who stole christma powel said like the who down in who vill who feast on who pud and rare who roast beast the commun industri wa prepar to feast on the deregulatori fruit it believ would inevit sprout from the act s fertil soil but thi feast the f c c grinch did not like in the least so it is thought thu powel wa indic that if he becam chairman he didn t expect to administ first aid to the see leck as part of the job he wa appoint to the chairmanship on the first dai of the bush administr twenti month into the administr nearli all the see leck ar dead or dy nearli all long distanc compani not just worldcom ar in seriou troubl cabl compani have lost half their valu satellit compani ar stagger the crash ha had an automat concentr effect becaus as new compani die the exist compani market share increas and if the exist compani ar in good shape financi thei have the opportun to pick up damag compani at bargain price dure the bush administr as the financi carnag in commun ha worsen the commun industri ha move in the direct of more concentr if the bell wind up protect their region monopoli in local phone servic and if thei also merg the countri will be on it wai to have a nation duopoli in local servic verizon in the east and s b c in the west and these compani could domin long distanc as well becaus of the poor health of the long distanc compani the cabl busi also seem close to have two domin nation compani aol time warner and comcast unlik the phone compani thei don t have to share their wire with other compani and so can more fulli control what materi thei allow to enter peopl s home as part of the complic bargain with interest group that led to the number telecom act the limit on concentr in the radio industri were significantli loosen and in the past six year the number of radio station owner in the unit state ha been cut by twenti five per cent todai a larg portion of local and nation radio new program is suppli by a singl compani westwood on a subsidiari of viacom in thi situat mani democrat and liber think the f c c should be hyperactiveth superhero of govern regul spring to the rescu of both consum and the commun industri it should try to breath life into the see leck and other new compani it should disallow merger maintain ownership limit and otherwis restrain the forc of concentr it should us the govern s monei and muscl to get new technologyespeci fast internet connectionsinto the home of peopl who can t afford it at current market price an analog that a lot of peopl in f c c world make is between telecom and the middl east the clinton peopl blame the bloodsh on the bush peopl becaus thei disengag when thei came into offic and the bush peopl blame it on the clinton peopl becaus thei rais too mani expect and stir too mani passion but michael powel s f c c ha not been hyperact powel ha been conduct intern polici review and reform the manag of the f c c and wait for the feder court and the congress to send him signal in mid septemb powel final initi a formal review of the f c c s limit on media concentr thi doesn t mean he ha been inact rather he ha been activ in a wai that further infuri hi criticsin a manner that smoothli blend the genial and the provoc he muse about whether the fundament premis of f c c world realli make sens while give the impress that he s have the time of hi life as chairman at hi first press confer when he wa ask what he wa go to do about the digit divid that is econom inequ in access to the interneth said you know i think there is a merced divid i d like to have on and i can t afford on at the nation cabl telecommun associ convent in chicago powel follow a troup of tumbler to the stage interrupt hi walk to the podium to perform a somersault not long ago i went to see powel in hi offic at the f c c until number when the commiss move to a new build in southwest washington near the citi s open air fish market f c c world wa at the western edg of downtown where everybodi would encount everybodi els at a few familiar restaur and bar todai the f c c build look like the offic of a mortgag compani in a suburban offic park even the chairman s suit though larg is beig carpet and fluoresc powel is a bulki man who wear gold rim glass and walk with a pronounc limp the result of injuri he suffer in a jeep accid in germani in number when he wa an armi offic becaus of the accid he left the armi and went to law school where he becam entranc with conserv idea about regul particularli the idea that the govern rather than try to correct the flaw of the market befor the fact prophylact as he like to sayshould wait till the flaw manifest themselv and then us antitrust litig to fix them he work briefli at a corpor law firm and then becam a protg of joel klein the head of the antitrust divis of the clinton justic depart and the man who led the govern s legal case against microsoft he wa recent appoint chancellor of the new york public school system it testifi to powel s polit skill that he is probabl the onli high offici in the bush administr who not onli serv in the clinton administr but also maintain close ti to bush s nemesi senat john mccain of arizona on of the thing about powel that annoi peopl is hi endur love of law school it s sort of like a law school studi session over there on democrat former commission said as if to confirm the charg powel when i arriv introduc me to four law student summer intern at the commiss whom he d invit to sit in i began by ask powel whether he agre with the found assumpt of the f c c for exampl could privat compani have apport the airwav among themselv without the govern be involv i think we ll never know powel said i don t think it s an automat bad idea the wai some peopl will argu land is probabl the best analogu we don t seiz all the land in the unit state and sai the govern will issu licens to us land if my neighbor put a fenc on foot onto my properti line there s a whole bodi of law about what i can do about that includ whether i can tear it down if a wireless compani wa interf with anoth wireless compani it s a similar proposit there ar scholar who argueinde the famou ronald coas treatis that won the nobel prize wa about thisthat spectrum polici is lunaci the market could work thi out in the kind of wai that we re accustom to talk to powel wa fun unlik most high govern offici he doesn t seem to be invest in appear dignifi or command he slump in hi chair and fiddl with hi tie and riff he speak in iron air quot he s like your libertarian friend in colleg who enjoi stai up all night ask impertin rhetor question about aspect of life that everybodi els take for grant but that he see as sentiment or illog after a while i ask him whether he thought hi predecessor excit about the number telecommun act had been excess i would start with a caveat powel said look i can t fault those judgment in and of themselv given the time and what peopl thought thei were not the onli on who were hyster about the opportun but frankli i ve alwai been a littl bit critic first of all anybodi who work with the act know that it doesn t come anywher close to match the hyperbol that wa associ with it by the presid on down about the kind of thing it s go to open up i mean i don t know what provis ar the inform superhighwai provis or what provis ar so digit orient or some of the thing that were a big part of the theatr of it introduct when on start read the detail on search often in vain for these provis but nonetheless there wa a rise dot com excit and an internet excit and peopl thought thi wa histor legisl and it certainli wa but we were suck helium out of balloon with the kind of expect that were be bandi around and thi is befor the economi or the market even get in troubl it wa a dramat exagger expectationbi the leadership of the commiss by politician by the market itself by compani themselv it wa a gold rush and led to some veri detriment busi decis on that govern encourag by it polici frankli everybodi want to see number go up on the board powel began imit an imagin true believ in the telecom act i want to see ten competitor twenti competitor i want to see thirti per cent market share fifti per cent market share i want the bell to bleed then we ll know we ve succeed now powel return to be powel i think that expect wa astonishingli unrealist in the short term thei want to see it while thei re there we were start to get drunk on the juic we were drink and the market wa get drunk on the juic we were drink there s no question we went too soon too fast too mani compani took on too much debt too fast befor the market realli had a product or a busi model how could the telecom act have been handl better we could have chosen polici that were less hellbent on a singl object and were slightli more balanc and put more econom disciplin in the system powel said monei chase what seem like govern promis opportun the problem with that is there s a morn after and we re in it and the problem is there is no short fix for thi problem thi debt is go to take year to bring down to a realist level in some wai for short term gain we paid a price in long term stabil powel went on to sai that it might have turn out differ if there had been a more reason level of invest no we wouldn t have everi home in america with competit choic yetbut we don t anywai i don t think it s the remonopol of telephon servic i don t bui that the bell will prosper but did anybodi believ thei wouldn t the part of the stori that didn t materi wa that peopl thought so would mci worldcom and sprint other local phone compani he ad hadn t materi as viabl busi either and thei never might everybodi s alwai sai the regul did thi and thi and thi but candidli the stori s quit the opposit i think the regul bent over backward for six year to give them a chanc condit don t get that good except onc everi thirti year and it didn t happen so whatev the reason we re look at a worldcom that s teeter we re look at a long distanc busi that ha had a rapid declin in it revenu base a t t is break itself up sprint ha struggl could the f c c have done anyth to make the long distanc compani stronger at the f c c i think i ll just be blunt my polit answer ye there s all kind of thing we can do at the margin to try to help but i can t find thirti billion dollar for worldcom somewher i can t mitig the impact of an account scandal and an s e c investig were i king it would be wonder but i don t have those kind of lever i don t know whether anybodi doe at some point compani ar expect to run themselv in a wai that keep them from dy powel couldn t have made it much clearer that he doesn t think it s hi respons to do anyth about the telecom crash he ha demonstr hi sure polit touch by make accommodationist gesturesin august for exampl five month after disband the f c c s account safeguard divis powel announc that he wa appoint a committe to studi account standard in the commun industri but that show that powel is better at ride out the storm than sai harvei pitt hi counterpart at the secur and exchang commiss and doe not mean that he plan to try to shore up the telecom industri i ask powel if it would bother him if for most peopl onli on compani provid cabl televis and onli on provid local phone servic ye he said it concern us that there s on of each of those thing but let s not diminish the import of there be on of each of those thing that still is a nice suit of commun capabl even if thei aren t direct analogu of each other anywai powel said befor long the phone compani will be abl to provid video servic over their line and the cabl compani will provid data servic over their line so there will be more choic so yeah we have thi anxieti we have on of everyth the question is doe it stai that wai the concentr of ownership and the concentr control of inform did not appear to troubl powel either he said that peopl confus big which bring mani benefit with concentr which distort market if thi were just econom it s easi if you were to sai to me mike just worri about econom concentr we know how to do thatth econometr of antitrust i can tell you when a market s too concentr and price ar go to rise the problem is other dimens like polit ideolog sometim emot take the question of if everybodi s control what you see the assumpt there is that somehow there ll be thi viewpoint a monolith viewpoint push on you by your media and you won t get divers i think that s a possibl i don t think it s nearli the possibl that s ascrib to it sometim powel explain sometim when we see veri point polit or parochi program it get attack as unfair i see some of the same peopl who claim thei want divers go crazi when rush limbaugh exist thei love divers but somehow we should run howard stern off the planet if it ha a point of view then it becom accus of bia and then we have polici like here hi tone went from iron to sarcast the fair doctrin which seem to me like the antithesi of what i thought those peopl care about so when somebodi is point and opinion we do all thi stuff in the name of journalist fair and integr or whatev to make them balanc it out f c c world abound in theori about michael powel on is that he can t make up hi mind about how to address the crisi in the industri he regulatesso he talk and talk and talk flamboyantli about the market in order to bui himself time anoth is that he s carri water for the arbock and the big cabl compani anoth is that he is plan to run for the senat from virginia or to be appoint attornei gener in a second bush term and doesn t want to do anyth at the f c c that would diminish hi chanc anoth is that he s wait to move until there is more consensu on some cours of action so that he doesn t wind up go first and get caught in the crossfir between the arbock and the cabl compani and the televis network in f c c world thi is known as the powel doctrin of telecom after colin powel s idea that the unit state should never commit itself militarili without a clear object overwhelm forc and an exit strategi and anoth is that he actual believ what he sai and think the telecommun crash is natur healthi and irrevers and more concentr would be just fine thi is why elect matter reed hundt who isn t happi about what ha becom of hi telecom act told me it s true that the f c c much more than sai the war in afghanistani a case in which a gore administr would be act quit differ from the bush administr consum might have notic the differ by now but there s no question whether commun compani have notic the arbock ar do better against their intern rival than thei would have done if gore had won next elect thei ll help the parti that help them if the republican win polici will tilt further in the arbock favor if thei lose perhap the arbock rivalsth long distanc compani and the telecommun upstartswith their friend now in power will stage a comeback america s present is not unrecogniz differ from america s past
