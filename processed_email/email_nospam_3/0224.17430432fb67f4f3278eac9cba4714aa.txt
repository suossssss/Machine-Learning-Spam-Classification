 httpaddr hamza s horrid but we must toler him rod liddl wednesdai august number number the guardian sheikh abu hamza al masri our maddest of mad mullah and a cartoon bogeyman to scare the kiddi spent a quiet and contempl bank holidai plai with hi own children in victoria park hacknei i ve often wonder what incendiari islam fundamentalist cleric do on statutori public holidai head for the beach and mayb swing by b q on the wai home i had hope i had thi beguil vision of hamza paddl in the sea an ic cream cone in hi on good hand the wave tickl hi shin and the sheikh mental prepar to fix those peski shelv in the kitchen for onc instead of plan the extermin of zionism and america and mayb me and you too but b q and a dai at the seasid is probabl beyond hamza s budget sinc the bank of england froze hi asset so victoria park had to do but he sound happi enough when i spoke to him with the babbl of tini cheer islam proto warrior in the background you must know hamza he s the imam design it would seem by the daili mail s cartoonist mac larg metal hook in place of a left hand on ey cover by a patch the other a bale watch milki white we don t mock the disabl ani more these dai unless it s someon like hamza whom we don t like then if you ll excus the inapt phraseolog the glove come off so hamza is known with that vault imagin typic of the british right as captain hook in articl which usual call for hi arrest or extradit to the us or deport back home to egypt or mayb off to pakistan or afghanistan where he fought the russian for year and thu sustain hi disabl anywher realli just out of here and if we can t lock him up or chuck him out of the countri mayb we can forc him to shut up becaus we don t like hamza veri much we weren t that fond of him befor septemb number but afterward in that nervi paranoid few month when we all thought the sky might fall in our disapprob turn into polit persecut and now the daili mirror is agit again for hi arrest becaus thei ve got hold of secret video of the man behav in an even more inflammatori manner urg warfar on and loot of enemi of islam all out of context and a veri long time ago sai the imam not unduli bother but perhap he should be becaus our reput for broad minded and toler toward peopl like hamza wa thin even befor the mirror s scoop hamza preach or preach at the scari finsburi park mosqu so earlier thi year the chariti commission ban him from do so becaus of hi allegedli inflammatori remark i didn t know chariti commission were meant to do stuff like that he ha had hi passport seiz and not return hi asset have been frozen he is tail by the polic everi now and then and hi access to the media is restrict by intern polic within broadcast corpor and the press and thi last point is becaus we tell ourselv endlessli repeat the mantra over and over again and fervent wish it to be true hamza is not repres of british muslim as if british muslim were a simpl homogen thing with a singl voic that on could turn to everi now and then for explan and perhap succour the troubl is in the first month or so after the twin tower attack he wa reveal to be rather more repres than the list of those govern approv muslim spokesmen who were uncomfort i suspect dragoon briefli into statement of support for the war against terror and a blanket condemn of the taliban an opinion poll commiss by radio number s todai programm reveal that an overwhelm major of british muslim were against georg bush s crusad on in six were to put it mildli ambival about the attack on the us the remaind condemn the attack unequivoc a larg major thought the war against terror wa a war against islam which is what hamza said repeatedli but it wa someth that at the time we didn t want to hear now if you quiz the man on present polici at home and abroad he come across superfici at least as someon from the liber left no war against iraq britain to becom independ of us foreign polici and attempt rapproch with arab state stronger action against israel mistrust of global capit redistribut of wealth nor is he particularli anti semit so far as i can tell although i don t suppos he will be holidai in eilat thi year in yesterdai s guardian the chief rabbi express a willing to talk to hamza and wa grate for the sheikh s messag of condol when a london synagogu wa attack which is not to sai that hamza is a peaceabl jeffersonian democrat who ha been wilfulli misrepres he is without question rather more inflammatori in privat sermon to hi own peopl than he is in public hi ideolog is an arid and uncompromis interpret of islam he would be happi in a truli islam societi to stone women to death for adulteri for exampl you and i would find mani perhap most of hi view utterli repel and that s the point becaus hamza is the true test of our appar desir to be multicultur multicultur is not sure the cheer appropri of bit of inoffens minor cultur behaviour by the rule hegemoni that is a sort of syncop monocultur multicultur is rather the abil of societi to toler view that ar antithet to the domin cultur and mayb learn from them the fbi ha been investig hamza but of cours ha found noth remot incrimin the real reason for hi vilif and persecut is simpli the pungenc of hi view it is often said that we should shut him up or arrest him becaus hi rhetor increas hostil against the muslim popul gener thi is a perfectli nobl argument but it doe not wash you don t defus a difficult situat by pretend it doesn t exist and if british muslim mayb a minor mayb not feel a grow sens of uneas or mystif at the direct of western foreign polici it is not becaus thei have been led in that direct by hamza shut the man up therefor won t make a differ it is rather as loui macneic had it the glass is fall hour by hour the glass will fall for ever but if you break the bloodi glass you won t hold up the weather yahoo group sponsor number dvd free s p join now httpaddr to unsubscrib from thi group send an email to emailaddr
