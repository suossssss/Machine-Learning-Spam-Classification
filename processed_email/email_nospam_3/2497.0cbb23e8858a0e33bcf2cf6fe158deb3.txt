 url httpaddr date number number numbertnumb number number number number clai shirki in prais of evolv system number thi entir articl could be rewritten to explain rss in fact let s do that if it were april fool s dai the net s onli offici holidai and you want to design a number novelti format number to slip by the wnumberc as a joke it might look someth like rss number numberx number number it would specifi limit on data valu then remov them then specifi requir element then make them option thu silent break an unknown number of parser around the world it would encourag us of entiti encod html in it most import element thu ensur both secur risk and unpredict displai for the end user it would ignor year of standard work in other field commit such egregi sin as defin a guid element that wasn t a guid and us an obsolet date format that couldn t easili be sort by date it primari method of extens would be to add new element to the core namespac without tell anyon or document them thu make it whole resist to dtd schema or valid of ani kind after year of worldwid deploy it would complet revers it add whatev you want extens rule in favor of namespac which the spec would neither defin nor elabor on after adopt namespac it would fail to deprec ani exist element semant ident to namespac element alreadi in wide us it would also fail to provid preced rule in case where a document attempt to sai the same thing in two differ wai thu ensur mass confus among produc and inconsist behavior across consum rss number numberx and number number ar the whoope cushion and joi buzzer of syndic format for anyon who ha tri to accomplish anyth seriou with metadata it s pretti obviou that of the variou implement of a worldwid syndic format we have the worst on possibl except of cours for all the other the problem with that list of rss defici is that it is also a list of necess number rss ha flourish in a wai that no other syndic format ha not despit mani of these qualiti but becaus of them the veri weak that make rss so infuri to seriou practition also make it possibl in the first place remov length limit on descript and make titl option open up rss to a whole new categori of produc the weblogg allow encod html in descript let publish reus both their exist content and the exist rss infrastructur without requir them to produc valid xhtml which could be embed directli into an xml document social more rather than technic rule prevent produc from intention introduc secur risk through malici script tag or unpredict displai through unclos html element few publish tool can produc real conform guid and it doesn t matter becaus virtual all rss parser ar written in high level languag where handl string is more effici than convert string to bytecod and handl bytecod as for date by convent an rss document is laid out in revers chronolog order and no on seem to be clamor for more flexibl furthermor it almost babyish xml syntax so far from ani seriou comput framework where ar the namespac where is the document type descript why is the aggreg enforc of conform so lax made it possibl for anyon want an rss feed to write on the effect of thi eas of implement onli becom clear when you compar it to the attempt over the year to number do rss right number number most notabl rss number number in the year number rss number number had three main benefit backward compat with rss number number which wa never wide deploi and which fell into obscur as soon as the much simpler rss number number wa introduc base on rdf specif a serial call rdf xml a spec which at the time and to thi dai continu to chang or threaten to chang two year later there ar no major languag or develop platform that ship with parser to consum rdf although mani perl python net have third parti rdf parser in variou state of develop and conform the releas version is gener out of date cv access is recommend you get the idea meanwhil rdf xml product tool ar so inconsist that even rdf expert recommend not us rdf tool to produc an rss number number feed if you want it to actual be read by ani major rss aggreg despit the two year old promis of better tool number it is now the year number and i built my rss number number feed number in the most sophist person publish system in the world number by manual type a mishmash of templat tag and angl bracket into a textarea of an html form extens through namespac which as mention abov have been haphazardli and poorli incorpor into rss number number where thei appear to be flourish evolv format number those that proce by be adapt and extend in a thousand small wai number have three main characterist that ar german to their eventu victori over strong central design format onli solut that produc partial result with imperfect tool can succe my rss feed is an xml document produc by a templat that i built in a textarea and consum by hundr of parser around the world that know noth of xml and hack apart my feed with regular express the world is litter with format that would have work if onli everyon had better tool if everyon in the world had a perfect rdf parser at their dispos it would be trivial to produc and consum all the world s metadata in rdf without such perfect tool both product and consumpt instantli becom nightmar there is no middl ground what is is wrong becaus evolv format have alwai been adapt to earlier condit and ar alwai be further adapt to present condit thei ar alwai behind the time rss wa be stretch with long descript option titl and entiti encod html even befor such practic were codifi in the spec and long befor all consum could handl them no evolv format is ever perfectli in sync with the challeng it face final orgel s rule name for the evolutionari biologist lesli orgel number number evolut is clever than you ar number as with the list of rss s obviou defici abov it is easi to point out what is wrong with ani evolv system at ani point in it life no on see rss number number and rss number number side by side could doubt that rss number number had the superior technolog that it number did thing right number howev the abil to understand what is miss at ani given moment doe not mean that on person or a small central group can design a better system in the long haul design format start out strong and improv logarithm evolv format start out weak and improv exponenti rss number number is not the perfect syndic format just the best on that s also current practic infrastructur built on evolv format will alwai be partial incomplet partial wrong and ultim better design than it
