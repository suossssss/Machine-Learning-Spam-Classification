 origin messag from emailaddr emailaddr behalf of robert harlei sent mondai septemb number number number number am to emailaddr subject re java is for kiddi reza b far wrote thi thread kind of surpris me i start code with c then c and move on to java and i think that robert harlei wrote look like a case of my experi is comprehens your s is anecdot thei don t know what thei re talk about well i sure don t claim that i think most peopl on fork probabl have more program knowledg than i do there s lot of experi out here reza b far wrote number the peopl who pai the wage don t give a flyin heck what program languag you write thing in thei just want it to work robert harlei wrote in my experi thei do care it ha to work certainli and in particular it ha to work with what thei ve alreadi got and it ha to work on client s system my limit experi of java start a few year ago when support on linux wa so terribl that i ran awai scream and haven t come back yet well i think until recent support for most thing on linux wa kind of shadi thing have got much better you re right in that the jdk us to suck on linux but then imho linux is still matur or at least develop tool for linux ar matur i ve been develop a few server side app that run on linux recent with jdk number number x and thei ve had no problem with great perform robert harlei wort microsoft ha announc that thei plan to remov java from window thei took it out of xp alreadi and it ha to be instal with a servic pack somehow i can t imagin them remov the abil to run c program hmmm do you realli think that ms is pull out java becaus it s a bad program languag or applic platform you don t think thi ha anyth to do with net be a competitor to java do you or that ms ha basic copi java with some addit featur and call it c isn t that alon an indic that thei actual do think that a vm is the right wai to go for most high level applic reza b far wrote number c and c forc the develop to solv problem such as memori manag over and over again robert harlei wrote can t sai i spend ani notic amount of time on memori manag issu apart from the fact that i frequent need number gb hmmm again you re tell me that you ve never had a nasti bug that took you a coupl of dai to track down that had to do with a memori leak i am not the best c c programm not even close but i ve known realli good on and even thei have nasti bug that have to do with memori manag howev occasion thei mai be it s about design pattern architectur high level stuff robert harlei wrote if your problem just requir applic of a design pattern to solv then it s trivial anywai irrespect of languag wow so you re tell me that unless the applic involv bit count it s trivial what about the applic itself what about high level problem such as task distribut work flow etc aren t most high level problem solv with high level solut like design pattern or do you solv high level problem by write optim c c code for exampl do you think that most peopl work on collabor framework there ar lot of them on thi list ar work on write an oper system with assembl that provid for a collabor environ i am amaz by the amount of time wast by peopl talk about low level problem that have been solv number million time over and over and over again robert harlei wrote you appear to be gratuit assert that c programm wast time on irrelev low level problem and java programm don t depend entir on the programm not the languag i can see how you could infer thi howev what i believ to realli be the case is that java is on of the best languag for write larg applic with mani compon that involv the collabor of more than three programm in those case it s alwai veri hard to get the programm to agre on api s memori manag techniqu etc with java the jcp take care of the discuss so that you don t sit around in a long meet try to decid what api to us to hook up to a databas jdbc or a messag bu jm number java is not just a program languag it s also a platform robert harlei wrote buzzword yike have you written db code with c c for differ databas just an exampl tri port a persist layer from window to unix sai you have informix run on solari and you want to port to window with ms sql bad idea but for the sake of the exampl would you rather deal with jdbc port or c c port that us informix driver and now you have to us odbc a monolith set of api s or a crap load of differ api s slice and dice the same problem number differ wai robert harlei wrote unsupport assert so ar you sai that there is a standard set of api s for c c for everyth asid to the minim ansi stuff is there a standard wai of deal with c c applic for variou domain problem messag databas persist etc that rival java i d like to know if there is on accept by everyon who write c c in that case i claim ignor not suggest that java is the golden hammer just that c c is overkil for most thing i even code in vb but vb is a true disgrac to program it s just lame java is object orient no flame mail from the anti oo peopl pleas that is a religi discuss and rel clean and i don t think that everi kid can write a well design java program kid typic don t understand variou design pattern and principl to my experi thei actual tend to think more of the low level problem want to rewrit and reinvent the world a tendenc that is much more possibl imho in c c than in java due to exist of standard api s
