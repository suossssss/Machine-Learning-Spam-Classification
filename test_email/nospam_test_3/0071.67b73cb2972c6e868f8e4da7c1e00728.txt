of review we ll discuss configur block devic in your kernel we ve talk about the differ type of devic in previou penguin shell issu fundament the two that you ll deal with the most ar block and charact devic these draw their type name from the wai thei handl data block devic receiv data for storag in chunk gener pre set size of data block hard drive ar block devic thei ll onli write chunk of data to storag thu the problem with shut down your machin uncleanli data intend for storag mai not in fact have been written at the time your power di or you hard kill your machin the system mai still be accumul data up to the proper block size befor commit it to the hard drive charact devic on the other hand receiv data in stream on charact at a time serial port ar a great exampl of charact devic thei handl data input and output on the fly rather than fill a buffer then commit the data the physic natur of these devic type goe a long wai toward explain why thei handl data as thei do a hard drive ha to physic spin up to store or retriev data you re actual chang the magnet properti of the disc surfac when you store data consequ a hard drive ha to know where there s free space on the disc surfac ha to move that area of the disc under the write head and try as best it can to group block of relat data togeth charact devic realli don t store data as much as thei send it off and forget about it the process is pure electr rather than electr and physic the serial port for exampl send data in a stream to your palm pilot the storag of the data is actual handl by the palm itself not a physic storag devic on the comput there s no need to spin up a drive and account for the data as is necessari with a hard drive the palm will also send a signal back to the comput confirm receipt of data that s an indic that charact devic often commun in both direct as well so when you re configur block devic in your kernel you re prepar the system for commun with a devic that will buffer data to a predetermin level then write that data as a block chang the physic properti of the hard drive disc surfac even though that s the highest level view of the process it still show how difficult a process physic data storag realli is in the block devic section you ll find mani option for physic data storag when configur thi section it s crucial to know as much about your exist hardwar as possibl what type brand of hard drive ar you us what s the interfac to the machin id parallel etc where is the drive locat on the local machin or on a network connect box becaus the variabl ar so broad it s nearli imposs to give you a stock configur tip that will work for your person machin everi time i can tell you thi you will have block devic normal a hard drive and a floppi and you need to answer as mani of the abov question as you can find out as much about these physic devic as you can and the configur process will be rel painless a warn you ll see more configur tip like thi as the seri continu to progress i ll certainli make hand on configur recommend where possibl there ar quit a few area where i can make such recommend howev where the variabl set is as broad as block devic
